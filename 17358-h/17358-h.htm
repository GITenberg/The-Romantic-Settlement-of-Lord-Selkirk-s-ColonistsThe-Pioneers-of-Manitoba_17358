    <div class="subchap">PREFACE
    </div>
    <p>The present work tells the romantic story of the Settlement of Lord Selkirk's
    Colonists in Manitoba, and is appropriate and timely in view of the Centennial
    celebration of this event which will be held in Winnipeg in 1912.</p>
    <p>The author was the first, in his earlier books, to take a stand for justice to be
    done to Lord Selkirk as a Colonizer, and he has had the pleasure of seeing the
    current of all reliable history turned in Lord Selkirk's favor.</p>
    <p>Dr. Doughty, the popular Archivist at Ottawa, has put at the author's disposal a
    large amount of Lord Selkirk's correspondence lately received by him, so that many
    new, interesting facts about the Settlers' coming are now published for the first
    time.</p>
    <p>If we are to celebrate the Selkirk Centennial intelligently, it is essential to
    know the facts of the trials, oppressions and heartless persecutions through which
    the Settlers' passed, to learn what shameful treatment Lord Selkirk received from his
    enemies, and to trace the rise<span class ="pagenum">6</span>from misery to comfort of the people of
    the Colony.</p>
    <p>The story is chiefly confined to Red River Settlement as it existed&mdash;a unique
    community, which in 1870 became the present Province of Manitoba. It is a sympathetic
    study of what one writer has called&mdash;"Britain's One Utopia."<span class ="pagenum">7</span></p>

    </div>
    <p>This is the City of Winnipeg. Its growth has been wonderful. It is the highwater
    mark of Canadian enterprise. Its chief thoroughfare, with asphalt pavement, as it
    runs southward and approaches the Assiniboine River, has a broad street diverging at
    right angles from it to the West. This is Broadway, a most commodious avenue with
    four boulevards neatly kept, and four lines of fine young Elm trees. It represents to
    us "Unter den Linden" of Berlin, the German Capital.</p>
    <p>The wide business thoroughfare Main Street, where it reaches the Assiniboine
    River, looks out upon a stream, so called from the wild Assiniboine tribe whose
    northern limit it was, and whose name implies the "Sioux" of the Stony Lake. The
    Assiniboine River is as large as the<span class ="pagenum">10</span><a name="Page_10"
    id="Page_10"></a> Tiber at Rome, and the color of the water justifies its being
    compared with the "Yellow Tiber."</p>
    <p>The Assiniboine falls into the Red River, a larger stream, also with tawny-colored
    water. The point of union of these two rivers was long ago called by the French
    voyageurs "Les Fourches," which we have translated into "The Forks."</p>
    <p>One morning nearly forty years ago, the writer wandered eastward toward Red River,
    from Main Street, down what is now called Lombard Street. Here not far from the bank
    of the Red River, stood a wooden house, then of the better class, but now left far
    behind by the brick and stone and steel structures of modern Winnipeg.</p>
    <p>The house still stands a stained and battered memorial of a past generation. But
    on this October morning, of an Indian summer day, the air was so soft, that it seemed
    to smell wooingly here, and through the gentle haze, was to be seen sitting on his
    verandah, the patriarch of the village, who was as well the genius of the place.</p>
    <p>The old man had a fine gray head with the locks very thin, and with his form, not
    tall but broad and comfortable to look upon, he occupied an easy chair.</p>
    <p>The writer was then quite a young man fresh<span class ="pagenum">11</span><a name="Page_11"
    id="Page_11"></a>from College, and with a simple introduction, after the easy manner
    of Western Canada, proceeded to hear the story of old Andrew McDermott, the patriarch
    of Winnipeg.</p>
    <p>"Yes," said Mr. McDermott, "I was among those of the first year of Lord Selkirk's
    immigrants. We landed from the Old Country, at York Factory, on Hudson Bay. The first
    immigrants reached the banks of the Red River in the year 1812.</p>
    <p>"I am a native of Ireland and embarked with Owen Keveny&mdash;a bright
    Hibernian&mdash;a clever writer, and speaker, who, poor fellow, was killed by the
    rival Fur Company, and whose murderer, De Reinhard, was tried at Quebec. Of course
    the greater number of Lord Selkirk's settlers were Scotchmen, but I have always lived
    with them, known them, and find that they trust me rather more than they at times
    trust each other. I have been their merchant, contractor, treaty-maker, business
    manager, counsellor, adviser, and confidential friend."</p>
    <p>"But," said the writer, "as having come to cast in my lot with the people of the
    Red River, I should be glad to hear from you about the early times, and especially of
    the earlier people of this region, who lived their lives, and came and went, before
    the arrival of Lord Selkirk's settlers in 1812." Thus the story-telling began, and
    patriarch and questioner made out<span class ="pagenum">12</span><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>
<span class ="pagenum">13</span><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a> from one source and another the
    whole story of the predecessors of the Selkirk Colonists.</p>

    <div class="subchap">AN EXTINCT RACE.
    </div>
    <p>"Long before the coming of the settler, there lived a race who have now entirely
    disappeared. Not very far from the Assiniboine River, where Main Street crosses it,
    is now to be seen," said the narrator, "Fort Garry&mdash;a fine castellated structure
    with stone walls and substantial bastions. A little north of this you may have
    noticed a round mound, forty feet across. We opened this mound on one occasion, and
    found it to contain a number of human skeletons and articles of various kinds. The
    remains are those of a people whom we call 'The Mound Builders,' who ages ago lived
    here. Their mounds stood on high places on the river bank and were used for
    observation. The enemy approaching could from these mounds easily be seen. They are
    also found in good agricultural districts, showing that the race were agriculturists,
    and where the fishing is good on the river or lake these mounds occur. The Mound
    Builders are the first people of whom we have traces here about. The Indians say that
    these Mound Builders are not their ancestors, but are the 'Very Ancient Men.' It is
    thought that the last of them passed away some four hundred years ago, just before
    the coming of the<span class ="pagenum">14</span><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>white man. At
    that time a fierce whirlwind of conquest passed over North America, which was seen in
    the destruction of the Hurons, who lived in Ontario and Quebec. Some of their
    implements found were copper, probably brought from Lake Superior, but stone axes,
    hammers, and chisels, were commonly used by them. A horn spear, with barbs, and a
    fine shell sinker, shows that they lived on fish. Strings of beads and fine pearl
    ornaments are readily found. But the most notable thing about these people is that
    they were far ahead of the Indians, in that they made pottery, with brightly designed
    patterns, which showed some taste. Very likely these Mound Builders were peaceful
    people, who, driven out of Mexico many centuries ago, came up the Mississippi, and
    from its branches passing into Red River, settled all along its banks. We know but
    little of this vanished race. They have left only a few features of their work behind
    them. Their name and fame are lost forever.</p>

    <div class="subchap">THE GAY FRENCHMAN.
    </div>
    <p>Then the conversation turned upon the early Frenchmen, who came to the West during
    the<span class ="pagenum">15</span><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a> days of French Canada, before
    Wolfe took Quebec. "Oh! I have no doubt they would make a great ado," said the old
    patriarch, "when they came here. The French, you know, are so fond of pageants. But
    beyond a few rumors among the old Indians far up the Assiniboine River of their
    remembrance of the crosses and of the priests, or black robes, as they call them, I
    have never heard anything; these early explorers themselves left few traces. When
    they retired from the country, after Canada was taken by Wolfe, the Indians burnt
    their forts and tried to destroy every vestige of them. You know the Indian is a
    cunning diplomatist. He very soon sees which is the stronger side and takes it. When
    the King is dead he is ready to shout, Long live the new King. I have heard that down
    on the point, on the south side of the Forks of the two rivers, the Frenchmen built a
    fort, but there wasn't a stick or a stone of it left when the Selkirk Colonists came
    in 1812. But perhaps you know that part of the story better than I do," ventured the
    old patriarch. That is the Story of the French Explorers.</p>
    <p>"Oh! Yes," replied the writer, "you know the world of men and things about you; I
    know the world of books and journals and letters."</p>
    <p>"Let us hear of that," said the patriarch eagerly.<span class ="pagenum">16</span><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></p>

    <p>Well, you know the French Explorers were very venturesome. They went, sometimes to
    their sorrow, among the wildest tribes of Indians.</p>
    <p>A French Captain, named Verandrye, who was born in Lower Canada, came up the great
    lakes to trade for furs of the beaver, mink, and musk-rat. When he reached the shore
    of Lake Superior, west of where Fort William now stands, an old Indian guide, gave
    him a birch bark map, which showed all the streams and water courses from Lake
    Superior to Lake of the Woods, and on to Lake Winnipeg. This was when the
    "well-beloved" Louis XV. was King of France, and George II. King of England. It was
    heroic of Verandrye to face the danger, but he was a soldier who had been twice
    wounded in battle in Europe, and had the French love of glory. By carrying his canoes
    over the portages, and running the rapids when possible, he came to the head of Rainy
    River, went back again with his furs, and after several such journeys, came down the
    Winnipeg River from Lake of the Woods, to Lake Winnipeg, and after a while made a
    dash across the stormy Lake Winnipeg and came to the Red River. The places were all
    unknown, the Indians had never seen a white man in their country, and the French
    Captain, with his officers, his men and a priest, found their way <span class ="pagenum">18</span><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>to the Forks of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. This
    was nearly three-quarters of a century before the first Selkirk Colonists reached Red
    River. The French Captain saw only a few Indian teepees at the Forks, and ascended
    the Assiniboine. It was a very dry year, and the water in the Assiniboine was so low
    that it was with difficulty he managed to pull over the St. James rapids, and reached
    where Portage la Prairie now stands, and sixty miles from the site of Winnipeg
    claimed the country for his Royal Master. Here he collected the Indians, made them
    his friends, and proceeded to build a great fort, and named it after Mary of Poland,
    the unfortunate Queen of France&mdash;"Fort de la Reine," or Queen's Fort. But he
    could not forget "The Forks"&mdash;the Winnipeg of to-day&mdash;and so gave
    instructions to one of his lieutenants to stop with a number of his men at the Forks,
    cut down trees, and erect a fort for safety in coming and going up the Assiniboine.
    The Frenchmen worked hard, and on the south side of the junction of the Red River
    with the Assiniboine, erected Fort Rouge&mdash;the Red Fort. This fort, built in
    1738, was the first occupation of the site of the City of Winnipeg. The French
    Captain Verandrye, his sons and his men, made further journeys to the far West, even
    once coming in sight of the Rocky Mountains. But French Canada was doomed.
<span class ="pagenum">19</span><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a> In twenty years more Wolfe was to
    wrench Canada from France and make it British. The whole French force of soldiers,
    free traders, and voyageurs were needed at Montreal and Quebec. Not a Frenchman seems
    to have remained behind, and for a number of years the way to the West was blocked
    up. The canoes went to decay, the portages grew up with weeds and underwood, and the
    Western search for furs from Montreal was suspended.</p>
    <div class="subchap">THE INDIANS OF THE RED RIVER.
    </div>
    <p>No man knew the Indian better than Andrew McDermott. No one knew better how to
    trade and dicker with the red man of the prairie. He could tell of all the feuds of
    tribe with tribe, and of the wonderful skill of the Fur Companies in keeping order
    among the Indian bands. The Red River had not, after the departure of the French,
    been visited by travellers for well nigh forty years. No doubt bands of Indians had
    threaded the waterways, and carried their furs in one year to Pigeon River, on Lake
    Superior, or to Fort Churchill, or York Factory on Hudson Bay. It was only some ten
    or fifteen years before the coming of the Selkirk Colonists that the fur traders,
    though they for forty years had been ascending the Saskatchewan, had visited Red
    River at all. No missionary had up to the coming of the<span class ="pagenum">20</span><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a> Colonists ever appeared on the banks of the Red
    River. Some ten years before the settler's advent, the fur traders on the upper Red
    River had most bitter rivalries and for two or three years the fire water&mdash;the
    Indian's curse&mdash;flowed like a flood. The danger appealed to the traders, and
    from a policy of mere self-protection they had decided to give out no strong drink,
    unless it might be a slight allowance at Christmas and New Year's time. Red River was
    now the central meeting place of four of the great Indian Nations. The Red Pipestone
    Quarry down in the land of the Dakotas, and the Roches Perc&eacute;es, on the upper
    Souris River, in the land of the wild Assiniboines were sacred shrines. At intervals
    all the Indian natives met at these spots, buried for the time being their weapons,
    and lived in peace. But Red River, and the country&mdash;eastward to the Lake of the
    Woods&mdash;was really the "marches" where battles and conflicts continually
    prevailed. Red River, the Miskouesipi, or Blood Red River of the Chippewas and Crees,
    was said to have thus received its name. Andrew McDermott knew all the Indians as
    they drew near with curiosity, to see the settlers and to speculate upon the object
    of their coming. The Indian despises the man who uses the hoe, and when the Colonists
    sought thus to gain a sustenance from the fertile soil of the <span class ="pagenum">21</span><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>field, they were laughed at by the Indians who caught
    the French word "Jardiniers," or gardeners, and applied it to them.</p>
    <p>The Colonists were certainly a puzzle to the Red man. To the banks of the Red
    River and to the east of Lake Winnipeg had come many of the Chippewas. They were
    known on the Red River as Sauteurs, or Saulteaux, or Bungays, because they had come
    to the West from Sault Ste. Marie, thinking nothing of the hundreds of miles of
    travel along the streams. They were sometimes considered to be the gypsies of the Red
    men. It was they coming from the lucid streams emptying into Lake Superior and thence
    to Lake Winnipeg, who had called the latter by its name "Win," cloudy or muddy, and
    "nipiy" water. When the Colonists arrived, the leading chief of the Chippewas, or
    Saulteaux, was Peguis. He became at once the friend of the white man, for he was
    always a peaceful, kindly, old Ogemah, or Chieftain.</p>
    <p>All the Indians were, at first, kindness itself to the new comers, and they showed
    great willingness to supply food to the hungry settlers, and to assist them in
    transfer and in taking possession of their own homes.</p>
    <p>The Saulteaux Indians while active and helpful were really intruders among the
    Crees, a great Indian nation, who in language and blood were their relations. As
    proof of this the Crees <span class ="pagenum">22</span><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>at this
    time used horses on the plains. The horse was an importation brought up the valleys
    from the Spaniards of Mexico. Seeing his value as a beast of burden, more fit than
    the dog which had been formerly used, they coined the word "Mis-ta-tim," or big dog
    as the name for the horse. Their Chiefs were, with their names translated into
    pronounceable English, "the Premier," "the Black Robe," "the Black Man," while
    seemingly Mache Wheskab&mdash;"the Noisy Man"&mdash;represented the Assiniboines. The
    Crees, so well represented by their doughty Chiefs, are a sturdy race. They adapt
    themselves readily enough to new conditions. While the northern Indian tribes met the
    Colonists, yet in after days, as had frequently taken place in days preceding, bands
    of Sioux or Dakotas, came on pilgrimages to the Red River. Long ago when the French
    Captain Verandrye voyaged to Lake of the Woods, his son and others of his men, were
    attacked by Sioux warriors, and the whole party of whites was massacred in an Island
    on the Lake. The writer in a later day, near Winnipeg, met on the highway, a band of
    Sioux warriors, on horse-back, with their bodies naked to the waist, and painted with
    high color, in token of the fact that they were on the warpath. On occasion it was
    the habit of bands of Sioux to find their way to the Red River Valley, and
<span class ="pagenum">23</span><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>the people did not feel at all
    safe, at their hostile attitude, as they bore the name of the "Tigers of the
    Plains."</p>
    <p>With Saulteaux, Crees, Assiniboines, and Sioux coming freely among them, the
    settlers had at first a feeling of decided insecurity.</p>

    <div class="subchap">THE MONTREAL MERCHANTS AND MEN.
    </div>
    <p>But the fur trade paid too well to be left alone by the Montrealers who knew of
    Verandrye's exploits on the Ottawa and the Upper Lakes. When Canada became British,
    many daring spirits hastened to it from New York and New Jersey States. Montreal
    became the home of many young men of Scottish families. Some of their fathers had
    fled to the Colonies after the Stuart Prince was defeated at Culloden, and after the
    power of the Jacobites was broken. Some of the young men of enterprising spirit were
    the sons of officers and men who had fought in the Seven Years' War against France
    and now came to claim their share of the conqueror's spoils. Some men were of Yankee
    origin, who with their proverbial ability to see a good chance, came to what has
    always been Canada's greatest city, on the Island of Montreal. It was only half a
    dozen years after Wolfe's great victory, that a great Montreal trader, Alexander
    Henry, penetrated the western lakes to Mackinaw&mdash;the Island of the Turtle, lying
    between Lakes Huron and<span class ="pagenum">24</span><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a> Michigan.
    At Sault Ste. Marie, "he fell in with a most noted French Canadian, Trader Cadot, who
    had married a Saulteur wife. He became a power among the Indians. With Scottish
    shrewdness Henry acquired from the Commandant at Mackinaw the exclusive right to
    trade on Lake Superior. He became a partner of Cadot, and they made a voyage as
    Canadian Argonauts, to bring back very rich cargoes of fur. They even went up to the
    Saskatchewan on Lake Winnipeg. After Henry, came another Scotchman, Thomas Curry, and
    made so successful a voyage that he reached the Saskatchewan River, and came back
    laden with furs, so that he was now satisfied never to have to go again to the Indian
    country. Shortly afterwards James Findlay, another son of the heather, followed up
    the fur-traders' route, and reached Saskatchewan. Thus the Northwest Fur Trade became
    the almost exclusive possession of the Scottish Merchants of Montreal. With the
    master must go the man. And no man on the rivers of North America ever equalled, in
    speed, in good temper, and in skill, the French Canadian voyageur. Almost all the
    Montreal merchants, the Forsythes, the Richardsons, the McTavishes, the Mackenzies,
    and the McGillivrays, spoke the French as fluently as they did their own language.
    Thus they became magnetic leaders of the French canoe<span class ="pagenum">25</span><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>men of the rivers. The voyageurs
    clung to them with all the tenacity of a pointer on the scent. There were Nolins,
    Falcons, Delormes, Faribaults, Lalondes, Leroux, Trottiers, and hundreds of others,
    that followed the route until they became almost a part of the West and retired in
    old age, to take up a spot on some beautiful bay, or promontory, and never to return
    to "Bas Canada." Those from Montreal to the north of Lake Superior were the pork
    eaters, because they lived on dried pork, those west of Lake Superior, "Couriers of
    the Woods," and they fed on pemmican, the dried flesh of the buffalo. They were
    mighty in strength, daring in spirit, tractable in disposition, eagles in swiftness,
    but withal had the simplicity of little children. They made short the weary miles on
    the rivers by their smoking "tabac"&mdash;the time to smoke a pipe counting a
    mile&mdash;and by their merry songs, the "Fairy Ducks" and "La Claire Fontaine,"
    "Malbrouck has gone to the war," or "This is the beautiful French Girl"&mdash;ballads
    that they still retained from the French of Louis XIV. They were a jolly crew, full
    of superstitions of the woods, and leaving behind them records of daring, their names
    remain upon the rivers, towns and cities of the Canadian and American Northwest.</p>
    <p>Some thirty years before the arrival of the<span class ="pagenum">26</span><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a> Colonists, the Montreal traders found it useful to form a Company.
    This was called the North-West Fur Company of Montreal. Having taken large amounts
    out of the fur trade, they became the leaders among the merchants of Montreal. The
    Company had an energy and ability that made them about the beginning of the
    nineteenth century the most influential force in Canadian life. At Fort William and
    Lachine their convivial meetings did something to make them forget the perils of the
    rapids and whirlpools of the rivers, and the bitterness of the piercing winds of the
    northwestern stretches. Familiarly they were known as the "Nor'-Westers." Shortly
    before the beginning of the century mentioned, a split took place among the
    "Nor'-Westers," and as the bales of merchandise of the old Company had upon them the
    initials "N.W.," the new Company, as it was called, marked their packages "XY," these
    being the following letters of the alphabet.</p>
    <p>Besides these mentioned there were a number of independent merchants, or free
    traders. At one time there were at the junction of the Souris and Assiniboine Rivers,
    five establishments, two of them being those of free traders or independents. Among
    all these Companies the commander of a Fort was called, "The Bourgeois" to suit the
    French tongue of the<span class ="pagenum">27</span><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a> men. He was
    naturally a man of no small importance.</p>
    <div class="subchap">"THE DUSKY RIDERS OF THE PLAINS."
    </div>
    <p>But the conditions, in which both the traders and the voyageurs lived, brought a
    disturbing shadow over the wide plains of the North-West. Now under British rule, the
    Fur trade from Montreal became a settled industry. From Curry's time (1766) they
    began to erect posts or depots at important points to carry on their trade. Around
    these posts the voyageurs built a few cabins and this new centre of trade afforded a
    spot for the encampment near by of the Indian teepees made of tanned skins. The
    meeting of the savage and the civilized is ever a contact of peril. Among the traders
    or officers of the Fur trade a custom grew up&mdash;not sanctioned by the
    decalogue&mdash;but somewhat like the German Morganatic marriage. It was called
    "Marriage of the Country." By this in many cases the trader married the Indian wife;
    she bore children to him, and afterwards when he retired from the country, she was
    given in real marriage to some other voyageur, or other employee, or pensioned off.
    It is worthy of note that many of these Indian women became most true and
    affectionate spouses. With the voyageurs and laborers the conditions were different.
    They could not leave the country, they<span class ="pagenum">28</span><a name="Page_28"
    id="Page_28"></a> had become a part of it, and their marriages with the Indian women
    were bona fide. Thus it was that during the space from the time of Curry until the
    arrival of the Selkirk Colonists upwards of forty years had elapsed, and around the
    wide spread posts of the Fur Trading Companies, especially around those of the
    prairie, there had grown up families, which were half French and half Indian, or half
    English and half Indian. When it could be afforded these children were sent for a
    time to Montreal, to be educated, and came back to their native wilds. On the plain
    between the Assiniboine and the Saskatchewan, a half-breed community had sprung up.
    From their dusky faces they took the name "Bois-Brul&eacute;s," or "Charcoal Faces,"
    or referring to their mixed blood, of "Metis," or as exhibiting their importance,
    they sought to be called "The New Nation." The blend of French and Indian was in many
    respects a natural one. Both are stalwart, active, muscular; both are excitable,
    imaginative, ambitious; both are easily amused and devout. The "Bois-Brul&eacute;s"
    growing up among the Indians on the plains naturally possessed many of the features
    of the Indian life. The pursuit of their fur-bearing animals was the only industry of
    the country. The Bois-Brul&eacute;s from childhood were familiar with the Indian
    pony, knew all his tricks and habits, began to ride with all<span class ="pagenum">29</span><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a> the skill of a desert ranger, were familiar with
    fire-arms, took part in the chase of the buffalo on the plains, and were already
    trained to make the attack as cavalry on buffalo herds, after the Indian fashion, in
    the famous half-circle, where they were to be so successful in their later troubles,
    of which we shall speak. Such men as the Grants, Findlays, Lapointes, Bellegardes,
    and Falcons were equally skilled in managing the swift canoe, or scouring the plains
    on the Indian ponies. We shall see the part which this new element were to play in
    the social life and even in the public concerns of the prairies.</p>
    <div class="subchap">THE STATELY HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY.
    </div>
    <p>The last of the elements to come into the valley of the Red River and to precede
    the Colonists, was the Hudson's Bay Company&mdash;even then, dating back its history
    almost a century and a half. They were a dignified and wealthy Company, reaching back
    to the times of easy-going Charles II., who gave them their charter. For a hundred
    years they lived in self-confidence and prudence in their forts of Churchill and
    York, on the shore of Hudson Bay. They were even at times so inhospitable as to deal
    with the Indians through an open window of the fort. This was in striking contrast to
    the<span class ="pagenum">30</span><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a> "Nor'-Wester" who trusted the
    Indians and lived among them with the freest intercourse. For the one hundred years
    spoken of, the Indians from the Red River Country, the Saskatchewan, the Red River
    and Lake Winnipeg, found their way by the water courses to the shores of the Hudson
    Bay. But the enterprise of the Montreal merchants in leaving their forts and trading
    in the open with the Indians, prevented the great fleets of canoes, from going down
    with their furs, as they had once done to Churchill and York. The English Company
    felt the necessity of starting into the interior, and so within six years of the time
    of the expedition of Thomas Curry, appeared five hundred miles inland from the Bay,
    and erected a fort&mdash;Fort Cumberland&mdash;a few hundred yards from the
    "Nor'-Westers'" Trading House, on the Saskatchewan River. By degrees before the end
    of the century almost every place of any importance, in the fur-producing country,
    saw the two rival forts built within a mile or two of each other. Shortly before the
    end of the 18th Century, the "Nor'-Westers" came into the Red River Valley and built
    one or two forts near the 49th parallel, N. lat.&mdash;the U.S. boundary of to-day.
    But four years after the new Century began, the "Nor'-Westers" decided to occupy the
    "Forks" of the Red and Assiniboine River, near where Verandrye's Fort Rouge had
<span class ="pagenum">31</span><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a> been built some sixty years
    before. Evidently both companies felt the conflict to be on, in their efforts to
    cover all important parts, for they called this Trading House Fort Gibraltar, whose
    name has a decided ring of the war-like about it. It is not clear exactly where the
    Hudson's Bay post was built, but it is said to have rather faced the Assiniboine than
    the Red River, perhaps near where Notre Dame Avenue East, or the Hudson's Bay stores
    is to-day. It was probably built a few years after Fort Gibraltar, and was called
    "Fidler's Fort." By this time, however, the Hudson's Bay Company, working from their
    first post of Cumberland House, pushed on to the Rocky Mountains to engage in the
    Titanic struggle which they saw lay ahead of them. One of their most active agents,
    in occupying the Red River Valley, was the Englishman Peter Fidler, who was the
    surveyor of this district, the master of several forts, and a man who ended his
    eventful career by a will made&mdash;providing that all of his funds should be kept
    at interest until 1962, when they should be divided, as his last chimerical plan
    should direct. It thus came about that when the Colonists arrived there were two
    Traders' Houses, on the site of the City of Winnipeg of to-day, within a mile of one
    another, one representing a New World, and the other an Old World type of mercantile
    life. It was plain<span class ="pagenum">32</span><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a> that on the
    Plains of Rupert's Land there would come a struggle for the possession of power, if
    not for very existence.<span class ="pagenum">33</span><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></p>

    <div class="subchap">"A SCOTTISH DUEL."
    </div>
    <p>Inasmuch as this tale is chiefly one of Scottish and of Colonial life, the story
    of the movement from Old Kildonan, on the German Ocean, to New Kildonan, on the
    Western Prairies&mdash;we may be very sure, that it did not take place without
    irritation and opposition and conflict. The Scottish race, while possessing intense
    earnestness and energy, often gains its ends by the most thoroughgoing animosity. In
    this great emigration movement, there were great new world interests involved, and
    champions of the rival parties concerned were two stalwart chieftains, of Scotland's
    best blood, both with great powers of leadership and both backed up with abundant
    means and strongest influence. It was a duel&mdash;indeed a fight, as old Sir Walter
    Scott would say, "a l'outrance"&mdash;to the bitter end. That the struggle was
    between two chieftains&mdash;one a Lowlander, the other a Highlander, did not count
    for much, for the Lowlander spoke the Gaelic tongue&mdash;and he was championing the
    interest of Highland men.<span class ="pagenum">34</span><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></p>
    <p>The two men of mark were the Earl of Selkirk and Sir Alexander Mackenzie. Before
    showing the origin of the quarrel, it may be well to take a glance at each of the
    men.</p>
    <p>Thomas, 5th Earl of Selkirk, was the youngest of seven sons, and was born in 1771.
    Though he belonged to one of the oldest noble families, of Scotland, yet when he went
    to Edinburgh, as a fellow student of Sir Walter Scott, Clerk of Eldon, and David
    Douglas, afterward Lord Reston, it was with a view of making his own way in the
    world, for there were older brothers between him and the Earldom. He was a young man
    of intense earnestness, capable of living in an atmosphere of enthusiasm&mdash;always
    rather given indeed to take up and advocate new schemes. There was in him the spirit
    of service of his Douglas ancestors, of being unwilling to "rust unburnished," and he
    was strong in will, "to strive, to seek, to find." This gave the young Douglas a
    seeming restlessness, and so he visited the Highlands and learned the Gaelic tongue.
    He went to France in the days of the French Revolution, and took great interest in
    the Jacobin dreams of progress. The minor title of the House of Selkirk was Daer, and
    so the young collegian saw one Daer depart, then another, until at last he held the
    title, becoming in 1799 Earl of Selkirk and was confirmed as the master of the
<span class ="pagenum">35</span><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a> beautiful St. Mary's Isle, near
    the mouth of the Dee, on Solway Frith. On his visits to the Highlands, it was not
    alone the Highland straths and mountains, nor the Highland Chieftain's absolute
    mastership of his clan, nor was it the picturesque dress&mdash;the "Garb of old
    Gaul"&mdash;which attracted him. The Earl of Selkirk has been charged by those who
    knew little of him with being a man of feudal instincts. His temper was the exact
    opposite of this. When he saw his Scottish fellow-countrymen being driven out of
    their homes in Sutherlandshire, and sent elsewhere to give way for sheep farmers, and
    forest runs, and deer stalking, it touched his heart, and his three Emigration
    Movements, the last culminating in the Kildonan Colonists, showed not only what title
    and means could do, but showed a kindly and compassionate heart beating under the
    starry badge of Earldom.</p>
    <p>Rather it was the case that the fur trading oligarchy ensconced in the plains of
    the West, could not understand the heart of a philanthropist&mdash;of a man who could
    work for mere humanity. Up till a few years ago it was the fashion for even
    historians, being unable to understand his motive and disposition, to speak of him as
    a "kind hearted, but eccentric Scottish nobleman."</p>
    <p>Lord Selkirk's active mind led him into va<span class ="pagenum">36</span><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>rious different spheres of human life. He visited France and studied
    the problem of the French Revolution, and while sympathizing with the struggle for
    liberty, was alienated as were Wordsworth and hundreds of other British writers and
    philanthropists, by the excesses of Robespierre and his French compatriots. When the
    Napoleonic wars were at their height, like a true patriot, Lord Selkirk wrote a small
    work on the "System of National Defence," anticipating the Volunteer System of the
    present day. But his keen mind sought lines of activity as well as of theory. Seeing
    his fellow-countrymen, as well as their Irish neighbors, in distress and also
    desiring to keep them under the British flag, he planned at his own expense to carry
    out the Colonists to America. Even before this effort, reading Alexander Mackenzie's
    great book of voyages detailing the discoveries of the Mackenzie River in its course
    to the Arctic Sea, and also the first crossing in northern latitudes of the mountains
    to the Pacific Ocean&mdash;he had applied (1802), to the Imperial Government, for
    permission to take a colony to the western extremity of Canada upon the waters which
    fall into Lake Winnipeg. This spot, "fertile and having a salubrious climate," he
    could reach by way of the Nelson River, running into Hudson Bay. The British
    Government refused him the permis<span class ="pagenum">37</span><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>sion necessary. Lord Selkirk's first visit to Canada was in the year
    1803, in which his colony was placed in Prince Edward Island. Canada was a country
    very sparsely settled, but it was then turning its eyes toward Britain, with the hope
    of receiving more settlers, for it had just seen settled in Upper Canada a band of
    Glengarry Highlanders. Lord Selkirk visited Canada by way of New York. To a man of
    his imaginative disposition, the fur trade appealed irresistibly. The picturesque
    brigades of the voyageurs hieing away for the summer up the Ottawa toward the land of
    which Mackenzie had written, "the Nor'-Wester" garb of capote and moccassin and
    snowshoe, and the influence plainly given by this the only remunerative industry of
    Montreal, caught his fancy. Then as a British peer and a Scottish Nobleman, the
    fun-loving but hard-headed Scottish traders of Montreal took him to their hearts. He
    met them at their convivial gatherings, he heard the chanson sung by voyageurs, and
    the "habitant" caught his fancy. He was only a little past thirty, and that Canadian
    picture could never be effaced from his mind. In after days, these "Lords of the
    North" abused Lord Selkirk for spying out their trade, for catching the secrets of
    their business which were in the wind, and for making an undue use of what they had
    disclosed to him. In this there<span class ="pagenum">38</span><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a> was nothing. His schemes were afire in his own mind long before, his
    Montreal experiences but fanned the flame, and led him to send a few Colonists to
    Upper Canada to the Settlement to Baldoon. This settlement was, however, of small
    account.</p>
    <p>In 1808 though inactive he showed his bent by buying up Hudson's Bay Company
    stock. During this time projects in agriculture, the condition of the poor, the
    safety of the country, and the spread of civilization constantly occupied his active
    mind. The Napoleonic war cut off the vast cornfields of America from England, and as
    a great historian shows was followed by a terrible pauperization of the laboring
    classes.</p>
    <p>There is no trace of a desire for aggrandizement, for engaging in the fur trade,
    or for going a-field on plans of speculation in the mind of Lord Selkirk. The feuds
    of the two branches of the Montreal Fur traders&mdash;the Old Northwest and the New
    Northwest&mdash;which were apparently healed in the year after the Colonization of
    Prince Edward Island, were not ended between the two factions of the united company
    led by McTavish&mdash;called the Premier&mdash;on the one hand and Sir Alexander
    Mackenzie on the other.</p>
    <p>During these ten years of the century, the Hudson's Bay Company had also
    established rival posts all over the country. The competi<span class ="pagenum">39</span><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>tion at times reached bloodshed, and financial ruin
    was staring all branches of the fur trade in the face.</p>
    <p>It was the depressed condition of the fur trade and the consequent drop in
    Hudson's Bay Company shares that appealed to Lord Selkirk, the man of many dreams and
    imaginations and he saw the opportunity of finding a home under the prairie skies for
    his hapless countrymen. It requires no detail here of how Lord Selkirk bought a
    controlling interest in the Hudson's Bay Company's stock, made out his plans of
    Emigration, and took steps to send out his hoped-for thousands or tens of thousands
    of Highland crofters, or Irish peasants, whoever they might be, if they sought
    freedom though bound up with hardship, hope instead of a pauper's grave, the prospect
    of independence of life and station in the new world instead of penury and misery
    under impossible conditions of life at home. Nor is it a matter of moment to us, how
    the struggle began until we have brought before our minds the stalwart figure of Sir
    Alexander Mackenzie&mdash;Lord Selkirk's great protagonist. Like many a distinguished
    man who has made his mark in the new world, and notably our great Lord Strathcona,
    who came as a mere lad to Canada, Alexander Mackenzie, a stripling of sixteen,
    arrived in Montreal to make his fortune. He<span class ="pagenum">40</span><a name="Page_40"
    id="Page_40"></a> was born as the Scottish people say of "kenn't" of "well-to-do" folk
    in Stornoway, in the Hebrides. He received a fair education and as a boy had a liking
    for the sea. Two partners, Gregory and McLeod, were fighting at Montreal in
    opposition to the dominant firm of McTavish and Frobisher. Young Alexander Mackenzie
    joined this opposition. So great was his aptitude, that boy as he was, he was
    despatched West to lead an expedition to Detroit. Soon he was pushed on to be a
    bourgeois, and was appointed at the age of twenty-two to go to the far West fur
    country of Athabasca, the vast Northern country which was to be the area of his
    discoveries and his fame. His energy and skill were amazing, although like many of
    his class, he had to battle against the envy of rivals. After completely planning his
    expedition, he made a dash for the Arctic Sea, by way of Mackenzie River, which
    he&mdash;first of white men&mdash;descended, and which bears his name. Finding his
    astronomical knowledge defective, he took a year off, and in his native land learned
    the use of the instruments needed in exploration. After his return he ascended the
    Peace River, crossed the Rocky Mountains, and on a rock on the shore of the Pacific
    Ocean in British Columbia, inscribed with vermillion and grease, in large letters,
    "Alexander Mackenzie, from Canada, by land, the Twenty-<span class ="pagenum">41</span><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>second of July, One Thousand Seven Hundred and
    Ninety-three." That was his record as the first white man to cross North America,
    north of Mexico. A few years afterwards he received the honor of knighthood for his
    discoveries. He gained much distinction as a leader, though the great McTavish in his
    Company was never very friendly to him. At length he retired, became a representative
    in the legislature of Lower Canada, and was for a time a travelling companion of the
    Duke of Kent. With a desire for loftier station, he settled in his native land,
    married the beautiful and gifted daughter of the House of Seaforth, and from her
    enjoyed the property of Avoch, near Inverness.</p>
    <p>Three years before the starting of Lord Selkirk's Colonists and before his
    marriage with Geddes Mackenzie, Sir Alexander took up his abode in Scotland. He was
    the guardian of the rights of the North-West Company and manfully he stood for
    them.</p>
    <p>Mackenzie was startled when he heard in 1810 of Lord Selkirk's scheme to send his
    Colonists to Red River. This he thought to be a plan of the Hudson's Bay Company, to
    regain their failing prestige and to strike a blow at the Nor'-Wester trade. To the
    fur trader or the rancher, the incoming of the farmer is ever obnoxious. The beaver
    and the mink de<span class ="pagenum">42</span><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>sert the streams
    whenever the plowshare disturbs the soil. The deer flee to their coverts, the wolf
    and the fox are exterminated, and even the muskrat has a troubled existence when the
    dog and cat, the domestic animals, make their appearance. The proposed settlement is
    to be opposed, and Lord Selkirk's plans thwarted at any cost. Lord Selkirk had in the
    eyes of the Nor'-Westers much presumption, indeed nothing less than to buy out the
    great Hudson's Bay Company, which for a century and a half had controlled nearly
    one-half of North America. The Nor'-Westers&mdash;Alexander Mackenzie, Inglis and
    Ellice&mdash;made sport of the thing as a dream. But the "eccentric Lord" was buying
    up stock and majorities rule in Companies as in the nation. Contempt and abuse gave
    place to settled anxiety and in desperation at last the trio of opponents, two days
    before the meeting, purchased &pound;2,500 of stock, not enough to appreciably affect
    the vote, but enough to give them a footing in the Hudson's Bay Company, and to
    secure information of value to them.</p>
    <p>The mill of destiny goes slowly round, and Lord Selkirk and his friends are
    triumphant. He purchases an enormous tract of land, 116,000 square miles, one-half in
    what is now the Province of Manitoba, the other at present included in the States of
    Minnesota and North Dakota,<span class ="pagenum">43</span><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a> on the
    south side of the boundary line between Canada and the United States. The
    Nor'-Westers are frantic; but the fates are against them. The duel has begun! Who
    will win? Cunning and misrepresentation are to be employed to check the success of
    the Colony, and also local opposition on the other side of the Atlantic, should the
    scheme ever come to anything. At present their hope is that it may fall to pieces of
    its own weight.</p>
    <p>Lord Selkirk's scheme is dazzling almost beyond belief. A territory is his,
    purchased out and out, from the Hudson's Bay Company, about four times the area of
    Scotland, his native land, and the greater part of it fertile, with the finest
    natural soil in the world, waiting for the farmer to give a return in a single year
    after his arrival. A territory, not possessed by a foreign people, but under the
    British flag! A country yet to be the home of millions! It is worth living to be able
    to plant such a tree, which will shelter and bless future generations of mankind.
    Financial loss he might have; but he would have fame as his reward.<span class ="pagenum">44</span><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></p>

    stopping of works of improvement that brings conditions which make poverty so

    <p>To the philanthropist or the benevolent sympathiser like Lord Selkirk, who aims at
    benefiting suffering humanity, it is not the trouble, the self-sacrifice, or the
    spending of money in relief that is the worry, but it is the bitterness, the
    suspicion, the unworkableness, and the selfishness of the poverty-stricken themselves
    that disturbs and distresses the benefactor's heart. It is often too the
    heartlessness and prejudice of those who oppose the benefactor's plans that causes
    the generous man anxiety and even at times despair. Poverty in its worst form is a
    gaunt and ravenous beast, that bites the hand of friend or foe that is stretched out
    toward it. So Lord Selkirk found it, when he undertook to help the poverty-stricken
    Celts of the Scottish Highlands and of the West of Ireland. He had the sympathising
    heart; he<span class ="pagenum">46</span><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a> had the true vision; and
    he had as few others of his time had, the power to plan, the invention to suggest,
    and the skill and pluck to overcome difficulties, but the carrying out of his intent
    brought him infinite trouble and sorrow. His prospectus, offering the means to the
    poverty-stricken people of reaching what he believed to be a home of ultimate plenty
    on the banks of the Red River, was an entirely worthy document. His first point is,
    that his Colonists will be freemen. No religious tenet will be considered in their
    selection. This was even freer that was that of Lord Baltimore's much-vaunted Colony,
    on the Atlantic Coast, for Baltimore required that every Colonist should believe in
    the doctrine of the Trinity. Then, the offer was to the landless and the penniless
    men. Employment was to be supplied; work in the employ of the Hudson's Bay Company,
    or free grants of land to actual settlers, or even a sale in fee simple of land for a
    mere nominal sum; free passages for the poor, reduced passages for those who had
    small means, food provided on the voyage, and the prospect of new world advantages to
    all.</p>
    <p>But the poor are timid, and they love even their straw-thatched cottages, and it
    needs active and decided men to press upon them the advantages which are offered
    them. The Emigration Agent is a necessity.<span class ="pagenum">47</span><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">
  </a></p>
    <p>The fur traders' country was at this time well known to many of the partners. It
    was by employing or consulting with some of these fur traders that Lord Selkirk
    obtained a knowledge of the Western land which he was to acquire. Years before the
    Colony began Lord Selkirk had been in correspondence with an officer who belonged to
    a well known Catholic family of Highlanders, the Macdonells, who had gone to the
    Mohawk district in the United States before the American Revolution, and had
    afterwards come to Canada as U.E. Loyalists. One of these, a man of standing and of
    executive ability was Miles Macdonell. He had been an officer of the King's Royal
    Regiment of New York, and held the rank of Captain of the Canadian Militia. This
    officer had a brother in the North-West Fur Company, John Macdonell, who, more than
    ten years before, had been in the service of his Company on Red River and whose
    Journal had no doubt fallen into the hands of his brother Miles. He had written:
    "From the Forks of the Assiniboine and Red Rivers the plains are quite near the
    banks, and so extensive that a man may travel to the Rocky Mountains without passing
    a wood, a mile long. The soil on the Red River and the Assiniboine is generally a
    good soil, susceptible of culture, and capable of bearing rich crops."</p>
    <p>He goes on to state, "that the buffalo comes<span class ="pagenum">48</span><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">
  </a> to the fords of the Assinboil, besides in these rivers are plenty of
    sturgeon, catfish, goldeyes, pike and whitefish&mdash;the latter so common that men
    have been seen to catch thirty or forty a piece while they smoked their pipes." To
    reach this land of plenty, which his brother knew so well, Miles Macdonell became the
    leader of Lord Selkirk's Colonists. He arrived in Great Britain in the year for the
    starting of the Colony, and immediately as being a Roman Catholic in religion went to
    the West of Ireland to recommend the Emigration scheme, obtain subscriptions of
    stock, and to engage workmen as Colonists. Glasgow was then, as now, the centre of
    Scottish industry, and it is to Glasgow that the penniless Highlanders flock in large
    numbers for work and residence. Here was a suitable field for the Emigration Agent,
    and accordingly one of their countrymen, Captain Roderick McDonald, was sent thither.
    The way to Canada was long, the country unknown, and it required all his persuasion
    and the power of the Gaelic tongue&mdash;an open Sesame to an Highlander's
    heart&mdash;to persuade many to join the Colonists' bank. It required more. The
    Highlander is a bargainer, as the Tourist in the Scottish Highlands knows to this
    day. Captain Roderick McDonald was compelled to promise larger wages to clerks and
    laborers to induce them to join. He secured less than half<span class ="pagenum">49</span><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a> an hundred men at Stornoway&mdash;the trysting
    place&mdash;and the promises he had made of higher wages were a bone of contention
    through the whole voyage.</p>
    <p>Perhaps the most effective agent obtained by Lord Selkirk was a returned trader of
    the Montreal merchants named Colin Robertson. He had seen the whole western fur
    country, and the fact that he had a grievance made him very willing to join Lord
    Selkirk in his enterprise.</p>
    <p>One of the Nor'-Westers in Saskatchewan a few years before the beginning of Lord
    Selkirk's Colony, was "Bras Croche," or crooked-arm McDonald. He was of gentle
    Scottish birth, but his own acquaintances declared that he was of a "quarrelsome and
    pugnacious disposition." In his district Colin Robertson was a "Bourgeois" in charge
    of a station. A quarrel between the two men resulted in Colin Robertson losing his
    position, and as we shall see he became one of the most active and serviceable men in
    the history of the Colony. Colin Robertson went among his countrymen in the Island of
    Lewis and elsewhere.</p>
    <p>And now as the time draws nigh for gathering together at a common port, the
    Stromness (Orkney), the Glasgow, the Sligo and the Lewis contingents to face the
    stormy sea and seek a new untried home, a fierce storm breaks out upon the land.
    Evidence accumulates that the<span class ="pagenum">50</span><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a> heat
    and opposition of the "Nor'-West" partners&mdash;Sir Alexander Mackenzie, Inglis and
    Ellice&mdash;shown at the general meeting of the Company, were to break out in
    numberless hidden and irritating efforts to stop and perhaps render impossible the
    whole Colonizing project.</p>
    <p>Just as the active agents, Miles Macdonell, Capt. McDonald and Colin Robertson,
    had set the heather on fire on behalf of Lord Selkirk's project, so the aid of the
    press was used to throw doubt upon the enterprise. Inverness is the Capital of the
    Highlanders, and so the "Inverness Journal," containing an effusion signed by
    "Highlander," was spread broadcast through the Highlands, the Islands, and the
    Orkneys, picturing the dangers of their journey, the hardships of the country, the
    deceitfulness of the agents, and the mercenary aims of the noble promoter.</p>
    <p>Before Miles Macdonell had cleared the coast of England, he wrote to Lord Selkirk:
    "Sir A. (Mackenzie) has pledged himself as so decidedly opposed to this project that
    he will try every means in his power to thwart it. Besides, I am convinced he was no
    friend to your Lordship before this came upon the carpet."</p>
    <p>No doubt Miles Macdonell was correct, and the two Scottish antagonists were face
    to face in the conflict. We shall see the means supplied by which the expedition will
    be harassed.<span class ="pagenum">51</span><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a> And now the
    enterprise is to be set on foot.</p>
    <p>For nearly a century and a half the Hudson's Bay Company ships have sailed yearly
    from the Thames, and taken the goods of the London merchants to the posts and forts
    of Hudson Bay, carrying back rich returns of furs. Sometimes more than one a year has
    gone. In 1811 there was the Commodore's ship the "Prince of Wales," with cabin
    accommodation and such comforts as ships of that period supplied. A second ship, the
    "Eddystone," chartered for special service, accompanied her. These two were intended
    to carry out employees and men for the fur trade, as well as the goods.</p>
    <p>It must not be forgotten that there was some want of confidence between the
    trading side of the Hudson's Bay Company and that which Lord Selkirk represented, in
    the Colonizing enterprise. Also at this time the laws in regard to the safety of
    vessels, the comfort of passengers, or precautions for health were very lax. While
    the records of emigration experiences of British settlers to Canada and the United
    States are being recited by men and women yet living in Canada, the want of resource
    and the neglect of life and property by Governments and officials up until half a
    century ago are heart-sickening. So the third ship of the fleet that was to carry the
    first human freight of Manitoba pioneers was the "Edward and Ann." She
<span class ="pagenum">52</span><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a> was a sorry craft, with old sails,
    ropes, etc., and very badly manned. She had as a crew only sixteen, including the
    captain, mates and three small boys. It was a surprise to Miles Macdonell that the
    Company would charter and send her out in such a state. The officers came down to
    Gravesend from London and joined their ships, and somewhere about the 25th of June,
    1811, they set sail from Sheerness on their mission, which was to become
    historic&mdash;not so historic, perhaps, as the Mayflower&mdash;but still
    sufficiently important to deserve a centennial celebration.</p>
    <p>The fleet was, however, to take up its passengers after it had passed Duncansby
    Head, on the north of Scotland. But the elements on the North Sea were unpropitious.
    Sheerness left behind, the trio of vessels had not passed the coast of Norfolk before
    they were driven into Yarmouth Harbor, and there for days they lay held in by adverse
    winds. On July 2nd they again started northward, when they were compelled to return
    to Yarmouth.</p>
    <p>In company they succeeded in reaching Stromness, in the Orkney Isles, in about ten
    days. Here the "Prince of Wales" remained and her two companions sailed down to
    Stornoway on the 17th.</p>
    <p>And now, with the storms of the German Ocean left behind, began the opposition of
    the<span class ="pagenum">53</span><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a> "Nor'-Westers." The "Prince of
    Wales" brought her contingent from the Orkneys, and on July 25th Miles Macdonell
    writes that after all the efforts put forth at all the points he had 125 Colonists
    and employees, and these were in a most unsettled state of mind.</p>
    <p>Some dispute the wages offered them. One party from Galway had not arrived. Some
    are irritated at not being in the quarter of the ship which they desired, and some
    anxiety is evident on the part of Miles Macdonell because large advances of money
    have been given to a number and he fears that they may desert. The expenses of
    assembling the settlers have been very heavy, and now opposition appears. Sir
    Alexander's party are doing their work. Mr. Reed, Collector of Customs at Stornoway,
    was married to a niece of Sir Alexander Mackenzie, and as collector he throws every
    obstacle in the way of Macdonell. He has also taken pains to stir up discontent in
    the minds of the Colonists and to advise them not to embark.</p>
    <p>Further trouble was caused by a Captain Mackenzie&mdash;called "a mean
    fellow"&mdash;who proved to be a son-in-law of the Collector of Customs Reed, and who
    went on board the "Edward and Ann," recruited as soldiers some of the settlers,
    himself handing them the enlisting money and then seeking to compel them to leave the
    ship with him. Afterwards, Cap<span class ="pagenum">54</span><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>tain
    Mackenzie came on board the "Edward and Ann" and claimed the new recruits, as
    deserters from the army. The Customs officials also boarded the emigrant ship and
    most officiously proclaimed that if any emigrants were not satisfied, or were not
    going of their own free will then they might go ashore, and the scene as described by
    Miles Macdonell may be imagined. "Several said they were not willing, and many went
    over the ship's side into Captain Mackenzie's boat. One party ran away with the
    ship's boat, but were brought back. One man jumped into the sea, and swam for it
    until he was picked up by the recruiting boat." The Revenue Cutter's boat was
    likewise very active in taking men away, and the collector took some ashore in his
    boat with himself. A prominent employee of the promoters of the expedition, Mr.
    Moncrieff Blair, who posed as a gentleman, deserted on July 25th, the day before the
    sailing of the vessel.</p>
    <p>No wonder that Miles Macdonell should write: "My Lord, this is a most unfortunate
    business * * * I condole with your Lordship on all these cross accidents."</p>
    <p>Thus amid annoyance, opposition, and discouragement did the little fleet set sail,
    on July 26th, 1811.</p>
    <p>But this time of Napoleonism in Europe affected even the high seas. French
    cruisers<span class ="pagenum">55</span><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a> might seize the valuable
    cargoes being sent out to York Factory. Accordingly a man-of-war had been detailed to
    lead the way. This had caused a part of the delay on the East Coast of England, and
    when fairly away from the British Isles and some four hundred miles northwest of
    Ireland, the protecting ship turned back, but the sea was so wild that not even a
    letter could be handed to the Captain to carry in a message to the promoter.</p>
    <p>The journey continued to be boisterous, but once within Hudson straits the weather
    turned mild, and the great walls of rock reminded the Highlanders of their
    Sutherlandshire West Coast.</p>
    <p>They saw no living being as they went through the Strait. Their studies of human
    nature were among themselves. Miles Macdonell reports that exclusive of the officers
    and crews who embarked at Gravesend, there were of laborers and writers one hundred
    and five persons.</p>
    <p>Of these there were fifty-three on the "Edward and Ann." Two men of especial note,
    representing the clerical and medical professions were on board the Emigrant Ship.
    Father Burke, a Roman Catholic priest, who had come away without the permission of
    his Bishop was one.</p>
    <p>Miles Macdonell did not like him, but he<span class ="pagenum">56</span><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">
  </a> seems to have been a hearty supporter of the Emigration Scheme and
    promised to do great things in Ireland on his return.</p>
    <p>When he reached York Factory, Burke did not leave the shore to follow the
    Colonists to their homes on the banks of Red River. He married two Scotch
    Presbyterians, and while somewhat merry at times had amused the passengers on their
    dreary ocean journey. More useful, however, to the passengers was Mr. Edwards, the
    ship's doctor.</p>
    <p>He had much opportunity for practising his art, both among the Colonists and the
    employees.</p>
    <p>At times Miles Macdonell endeavored on shipboard to drill his future servants and
    settlers, but he found them a very awkward squad&mdash;not one had ever handled a gun
    or musket. The sea seemed generally too tempestuous in mood for their evolutions. As
    the ships approached York Factory the interest increased. The "Eddystone" was
    detailed to sail to "Fort Churchill," but was unable to reach it and found her way in
    the wake of the other vessels to York Factory. It seemed as if the sea-divinities all
    combined to fight against the Colonists, for they did not reach York Factory, the
    winter destination, until the 24th of September, having taken sixty-one days on the
    voyage from Stornoway, which was declared by the Hud<span class ="pagenum">57</span><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>son's Bay Company officers to be the longest and latest passage ever
    known on Hudson Bay. Then settlers and employees were all landed on the point, near
    York Factory, and were sheltered meantime in tents, and as they stood on the shore
    they saw on October 5th, the ships that had brought them safely across the stormy sea
    pass through a considerable amount of floating ice on their homeward journey to
    London.</p>
    <p>For one season at least the settlers will face the rigor of this Northern Clime.

    <div class="subchap">A WINTER OF DISCONTENT.
    </div>
    <p>The Emigrant ship has landed its living freight at Fort Factory, upon the Coast of
    Hudson Bay&mdash;a shore unoccupied for hundreds of miles except by a few Hudson's
    Bay Company forts such as those at the mouth of the Nelson River, and of Fort
    Churchill, a hundred miles or more farther north. It was now the end of the season,
    and it will not do to trifle with the nip of cold "Boreas" on the shore of Hudson
    Bay. The icy winter is at hand, and all know that they will face such temperatures as
    they never had seen even among the stormy Hebrides, or in the Northward Orkneys. Lord
    Selkirk's dreams are now to be tested. Is the story of the Colony to be an epic or a
    drama?</p>
    <p>It was by no means the first experiment of facing in an unprepared way the rigors
    of a North American winter.</p>
    <p>In the fourth year of the Seventeenth Century De Monts, a French Colonizer, had a
    band of his countrymen on Douchet's Island, in the<span class ="pagenum">59</span><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">
  </a> Ste. Croix River, on the borders of New Brunswick. Though fairly
    well provided in some ways yet the winter proved so trying that out of the number of
    less than eighty, nearly one-half died. The winter was so long, weary and deadly,
    that in the spring the survivors of the Colony were moved to Port Royal in Acadia and
    the Ste. Croix was given up. This was surely dramatic; this was tragic indeed. But in
    the fourth year of this Century, the Tercentenary of this event was celebrated in
    Annapolis and St. John, as the writer himself beheld, and the shouts and applause of
    gathered thousands made a great and patriotic epic.</p>
    <p>Again four years after De Monts, when knowledge of climate and conditions had
    become known to the French pioneers, Samuel de Champlain wintered with his crew and a
    few settlers on the site of Old Quebec, on the St. Lawrence. Discontent and
    dissension led to rebellion, and blood was shed in the execution of the plotters.
    Hunger, suffering and the dreadful scurvy attacked the founder's party of less than
    thirty, of whom only ten survived, and yet in July of 1908, the writer witnessed the
    grand Tercentenary celebration of Champlain's settlement of Quebec, and with the
    presence of the Prince of Wales, General Roberts, the idol of the British Army, a
    joint fleet, of eleven English, French and American first-<span class ="pagenum">60</span><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>class Men-of War, with pageantry and music, the Epic
    of Champlain was sung at the foot of the great statue erected to his memory.</p>
    <p>In the Twentieth year of the Seventeenth Century, a company of very sober folk,
    came to the shore of the Atlantic Ocean in a trifling little vessel the "Mayflower,"
    and brought about one hundred Immigrants from the British Isles to Plymouth Rock to
    build up a refuge and a home. What a mighty song of patriotism will burst out when in
    a few years the United States hold their Tercentenary of the landing of the Pilgrim
    Fathers.</p>
    <p>And so we see the first Selkirk Colonists landed on the Hudson Bay numbering at
    the outside seventy, a number not greatly different from the French and Pilgrim
    Fathers and called on to pass through similar trials in the severe winter of Hudson
    Bay. Their experience has been less tragic than that of the other parties spoken of,
    but in it the same elements of discomfort, dissension and disease certainly present
    themselves. However distressing their winter was, the dramatic conditions passed
    away, in a short time we shall be engaged in commemorating the patience and the
    heroism of these settlers, and in 1912 we shall sing a new song&mdash;the epic of the
    Lord Selkirk Colonists.</p>
    <p>But to be true we must look more closely at<span class ="pagenum">61</span><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">
  </a> the trials, and sufferings of the untried, and somewhat turbulent
    band, on their way to the Red River.</p>
    <p>York Factory as being the port of entry for the southern prairie country was a
    place of some importance. As in the largest number of cases, other than a few huts
    for workmen, and a few Indian families, the Fort was the only centre of life in the
    whole region. Two rivers, the Nelson and the Hayes, enter the Hudson Bay at this
    point&mdash;the Nelson being the more northerly of the two. Between the two rivers is
    really a delta or low swampy tongue of land. On the Nelson's north bank, the land
    near the Bay is low, while inland there is a rising height. Five or six different
    sites of forts are pointed out at this point. These have been built on during the
    history of the Company, which dates back to 1670. In Lord Selkirk's time the factory
    was more than half a mile from the Bay and lay between the two rivers. Miles
    Macdonell states that it was on "low, miry ground without a ditch." The stagnant
    water by which the post was surrounded would be productive of much ill-health, were
    there a longer summer. The buildings of the Factory were also badly planned, and
    badly constructed, so that the Fort was unsuitable for quartering the Colonists.
    Besides this, Messrs. Cook and Auld, the former Governor of York Factory, and the
<span class ="pagenum">62</span><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a> latter chief officer of Fort
    Churchill, having the old Hudson's Bay Company's spirit of dislike of Colonists,
    decided that the new settlers, being an innovation and an evil, should have separate
    quarters built for them at a distance from the Fort.</p>
    <p>Poor Colonists! Miles Macdonell is wearied with them in their complaining spirit,
    berates them for indolence, and finds fault with their awkwardness as workmen. To
    Macdonell, who was a Canadian, accustomed as a soldier and frontiersman to dealing
    with canoes, boats, and every means of land transport, the sturdy, steady going
    Orkneyman was slow and clumsy.</p>
    <p>The inexperienced new settler thus gets rather brusque treatment from the
    Colonial, more a good deal than he deserves.</p>
    <p>Accordingly it was decided to erect log dwellings for the workmen and the settlers
    on the higher ground north of the Nelson River. Several miles distant from the
    Factory itself, Spruce trees of considerable size grew along the river, and so all
    hands were put to work to have huts or shanties erected to protect the Colonists from
    the severe cold of winter, which would soon be upon them, although on October 5th
    Miles Macdonell wrote home to Lord Selkirk: "The weather has been mild and pleasant
    for some days past."</p>
    <p>The erection of suitable houses, that is home<span class ="pagenum">63</span><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>ly on the exterior, but warm in the coldest weather, was
    superintended by Miles Macdonell&mdash;himself a Colonial and one aware of the
    precautions needing to be taken.</p>
    <p>Amid all the troubles and complaints of the winter there were none against the
    suitableness of the log dwellings which were erected on the chosen site to which was
    given the name, "Nelson Encampment." Winter, however, came in fiercely enough in
    November, although again on the 29th of November, Macdonell writes to Cook, Governor
    of the Factory: "A mild day enables us to send a boat across the Nelson with the
    Express." It was open water on the river.</p>
    <p>Macdonell knew well that with the recent arrivals from the Old Land, one of the
    greatest dangers would be the weakening and dangerous disease of scurvy. He had
    sought for supplies of "Essence of Malt" and "Crystallized Salts of Lemon," and at the
    beginning of December as the people were living chiefly on salt provisions and a
    short allowance of oatmeal the scurvy made its appearance. Medical care was given by
    Mr. Edwards and the disease was at once met. However within a month one-third of the
    Immigrants were thus afflicted and the fear was that the malady would go through the
    whole Encampment. But the remedy that Champlain found so effective at
    Quebec&mdash;the juice of the Spruce tree, which grew in abun<span class ="pagenum">64</span><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>dance around the Encampment&mdash;checked the
    disease, wherever the obstinacy of the settlers did not prevent its use, for says
    Macdonell, "It is not an easy matter to get the Orkneymen to drink it, particularly
    the old hands." A smouldering fire of discontent that had been detected on board the
    ship on crossing the ocean now broke out into a flame. The Irish and the Orkneymen
    could not agree. In February the vigilant leader Macdonell writes: "The Irish
    displayed their native propensity and prowess on the first night of the year, by
    unmercifully beating some Orkneymen. Too much strong drink was the chief incitement."
    This antipathy continued to be a difficulty even until the party arrived at Red
    River.</p>
    <p>There are signs in his letters, of the constant strain on Miles Macdonell arising
    from the difficulties of his position and the waywardness of the Immigrants. At times
    he consults with the Hudson's Bay Company's officer, Mr. Hillier, and at others thus
    unbosoms himself to Messrs. Cook and Auld. "In this wild, desolate and (I may add)
    barren region, excluded at present from all communication with the civilized world,
    intelligence of a local kind can alone be expected. Could we join in the sentinel's
    cry of 'All is well,' although not affording great changes, it might yet be
    satisfactory in our isolated condition. We have as great variety<span class ="pagenum">65</span><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a> as generally happens in this sublunary world, of
    which we here form a true epitome, being composed of men of all countries, religions
    and tongues."</p>
    <p>Plainly Governor Macdonell feels his burdens! However, the culmination of this
    officer's troubles did not reach him until a serious rebellion occurred among his
    subjects&mdash;so mixed and various.</p>
    <p>A workman&mdash;William Finlay&mdash;presumably an Orkneyman, who had been
    regularly employed by Miles Macdonell when the scurvy was bad in Mr. Hillier's camp,
    refused to obey the health regulations, his one objection being to drink this spruce
    decoction. He was immediately dropped from work. A few days afterward supposing the
    matter had blown over, Macdonell ordered him to work again. Finlay declined,
    whereupon, though under engagement he refused to further obey Macdonell. The Governor
    then brought him before Mr. Hillier, who like himself, had been made a magistrate.
    His breach of law in this, as in other matters being brought against Finlay he was
    sentenced to confinement. There being no prison at York Factory it seemed difficult
    to carry out the sentence by his being simply confined with his other companions in
    the men's quarters. Accordingly the Governor ordered a single log hut to be
    constructed, and this being done, in<span class ="pagenum">66</span><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">
  </a> it the prisoner was confined. Not a day had entirely passed when a
    rebellion arose among some of his compatriots&mdash;the Scottish contingent from
    Orkney and Glasgow&mdash;and a band of thirteen of them surrounded the newly built
    hut, set it on fire and as it went up in smoke rescued the prisoner.</p>
    <p>The men were arrested and were brought before Macdonell and Hillier, sitting as
    magistrates. This was about the end of February. The rebels, however, defied the
    authorities, departed carrying Finlay with them and getting possession of a house
    took it defiantly for their own use. During their remaining sojourn at York Factory
    they subsisted on provisions obtained at the Factory itself and carried by themselves
    from the post to the encampment. Governor Macdonell, meantime, decided to send these
    rebellious spirits home to Britain for punishment, and not allow them to go on to Red
    River.</p>
    <p>The possession by the rioters of some five or six stand of firearms, was felt to
    be a menace to the peace of the encampment. An effort was made to obtain them by
    Macdonell, but "the insurgents," as they were called, secreted the arms and thus kept
    possession of them. In June on the rebels being very bold and being unable to get
    back across the Nelson River from the Factory for a number of days, they
<span class ="pagenum">67</span><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a> were forced by Mr. Auld, then at
    York Factory, to give up their arms and submit or else have their supplies from the
    Factory stopped. They were thus compelled to submit and on the receipt of a note from
    Mr. Auld to Macdonell, the latter wrote a joyful letter to Lord Selkirk to the effect
    that the insurgents had at length come to terms, acknowledged their guilt and thrown
    themselves upon the mercy of the Hudson's Bay Committee.</p>
    <p>This surrender made it unnecessary to send the body of rioters back to England for
    trial.</p>
    <p>During the months of later winter Governor Miles Macdonell was specially employed
    in building boats for the journey up to Red River. He introduced a style of boat used
    on the rivers of New York, his native State. These, however, he complains, were very
    badly constructed through the clumsiness and lack of skill of the Colonists and
    Company employees, whom he had ordered to build them.</p>
    <p>Now on July fourth, 1812, Governor Macdonell, his Colonists, and the Hudson's Bay
    officials&mdash;Cook and Auld&mdash;are all gazing wistfully up the Nelson and Hayes
    Rivers, and we have the postscript to the last letter as found in Miles Macdonell
    letter book, sent to Lord Selkirk, reading, "Four Irishmen are to be sent home;
    Higgins and Hart, for the felonious attack on the Orkneymen; William Gray, non-<span class ="pagenum">68</span><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>effective, and Hugh Redden, who
    lost his arm by the bursting of a gun given him to fire off by Mr. Brown, one of the
    Glasgow clerks."<br />(Signed) H. MacD.<br />
    </p>
    <p>The expedition left York Factory for the interior on the 6th of July, 1812.

    <div class="subchap">FIRST FOOT ON RED RIVER BANKS.
    </div>
    <p>The weary winter passing at Nelson Encampment had its bright spots. Miles
    Macdonell in the building erected for himself, on the south side of the Nelson River,
    kept up his mess, having with him Mr. Hillier, Priest Bourke, Doctor Edwards, and
    Messrs. John McLeod, Whitford and Michael Macdonell, officers and clerks. Those
    Immigrants who took no part in the rebellion fared well. True, the scurvy seized
    several of them, but proved harmless to those who obeyed the orders and took
    plentiful potations of spruce beer. With the opening year a fair supply of fresh and
    dried venison was supplied by the Indians. In April upwards of thirty deer were
    snared or shot by the settlers. Some three thousand deer of several different kinds
    crossed the Nelson River within a month. "Fresh venison," writes Macdonell, "was so
    plenty that our men would not taste salt meat. We have all got better since we came
    to Hudson Bay."</p>
    <p>But as in all far northern climates the heat<span class ="pagenum">70</span><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">
  </a> was great in the months of May and June, and Governor and Colonists
    became alike restless to start on the inland journey.</p>
    <p>The passing out of the ice in north-flowing rivers is always wearisome for those
    who are waiting to ascend. Beginning to melt farther south, the ice at the mouth is
    always last to move. Besides, the arrival was anxiously awaited of Bird, Sinclair and
    House. By continuous urging of the dull and inefficient workmen to greater effort,
    Miles Macdonell had succeeded in securing four boats&mdash;none too well
    built&mdash;but commodious enough to carry his boat-crews, workmen, and
    Colonists.</p>
    <p>Though Macdonell sought for the selection of the workmen who were to accompany him
    to Red River, he was not able to move the Hudson's Bay Company officials. Two days,
    however, after arrival of the Company magnates from the interior his men were secured
    to him, and he was fully occupied in transporting his stores up the river as far as
    the "Rock"&mdash;the rapids of the Hill River which here falls into Hayes River. For
    a long distance up the river there is a broad stream, one-quarter of a mile wide,
    running at the rate of two miles an hour through low banks. The boatmen have a good
    steady pull up the river for some sixty miles, and here where the Steel River enters
    the Hayes is seen a wide, deep, rapid stream run<span class ="pagenum">71</span><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>ning about three miles an hour. The banks of this river are of clay
    and rising from fifty to one hundred feet, the clay of the banks is so smooth and
    white that a traveller has compared them in color to the white, chalk cliffs of
    Dover. Thus far though it has required exertion on the part of the boatmen, a good
    stretch of a hundred miles from the Factory has been passed without any obstruction
    or delay. Now the serious work of the journey begins. The Hill River, as this part of
    the river is called, is a series of rapids and portages&mdash;where the cargo and
    boat have both to be carried around a rapid; of decharges where the cargo has thus to
    be carried, and of semi-decharges&mdash;where a portion of the cargo only needs to be
    removed.</p>
    <p>At times waterfalls require to be circuited with great effort. A high mountain or
    elevated table-land seen from this river shows the rough country of which these
    cascades and rapids are the proof. Here are the White-Mud Falls and other smaller
    cataracts. To the expert voyageur such a river has no terrors, but to the raw-hand
    the management of such boats is a most toilsome work. The birch-bark canoe is a mere
    trifle on the portage, but the heavy York boat capable of carrying three or four tons
    is a clumsy lugger. The cargo must be moved, the non-effectives such as the women and
    children and the old men must trudge the weary<span class ="pagenum">72</span><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">
  </a> path, varying from a few hundred yards to several miles along a
    rocky, steep and rugged way. When the portage is made the whole force of boatmen and
    able-bodied passengers are required to stand by each boat, pull it out of the water,
    and then skid or drag or cajole it along till it is thrust into its native element
    again. To the willing crofter or Orkney boatmen this was not a great task, but to the
    Glasgow immigrant, or the lazy waiter-on-fortune this was hard work. Many
    were the oaths of the officers and the complaints and objections of the men when they
    were required to grapple with the foaming cascades, the fearful rapids and the
    difficult portages of Hill River. Mossy Portage being now past the landing on a rocky
    island at the head of the river showed that the first "Hill Difficulty" had been
    overcome.</p>
    <p>Swampy lake for ten miles gives a comparative rest to the toiling crews, but at
    the end of it a short portage passed takes the beleagured party into the mouth of the
    Jack Tent River. Day after day with sound sleep when the mosquitoes would permit, the
    unwilling voyageurs continued their journey. Ten portages have to be faced and
    overcome as the brigade ascends the rapid Jack Tent River, covering a stretch of
    seventy miles. The party now find themselves on the surface of Knee Lake, a
    considerable sheet of water, but a comparative rest after<span class ="pagenum">73</span><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a> the trials of Jack Tent River. The lake is fifty-six
    miles long and at times widens to ten miles across.</p>
    <p>But there is trouble just ahead.</p>
    <p>The travellers have now come to the celebrated Fall Portage. It is short but
    deterrent. The height and ruggedness of the rocks over which cargo and boats have to
    be dragged are unusually forbidding. The only consolation to the contemplative soul,
    who does not have to portage, is that "The stream is turbulent and unfriendly in the
    extreme, but in romantic variety, and in natural beauty nothing can exceed this
    picture." High rocks are seen, beetling over the rapids like towers, and are rent
    into the most diversified forms, gay with various colored masses, or shaded by
    overhanging hills&mdash;now there is a tranquil pool lying like a sheet of
    silver&mdash;now the dash and foam of a cataract&mdash;these are but parts of this
    picturesque and striking scene.</p>
    <p>But Fall Portage was only a culmination, in this fiercely rushing Trout River, for
    above it a dozen rapids are to be passed with toilsome energy. After this the party
    is rewarded with beautiful islets, and the lake for a length of thirty-five miles
    lies in a fertile tract of country. It was formerly appropriately called Holy Lake,
    and as a summit lake suggests to the traveller abiding restfulness. To the traders on
    their<span class ="pagenum">74</span><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a> route whether passing up or
    down the water courses, it was always so. After the long and tedious voyaging it was
    their Elysium. Not only are the sweet surroundings of the lake most charming, but the
    Indians of the neighborhood have always been noted for their good character, their
    docility and their industry.</p>

    <p>A short delay at Oxford House led to the con<span class ="pagenum">75</span><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>tinuation of the journey over what was now the roughest, most
    desolate, and most trying part of the voyage. On this rough passage, perhaps the most
    distressing spot was "Windy Lake," a small but tempestuous sheet. The voyageurs
    declare that they never cross "Lac de Vent" without encountering high winds and very
    often dangerous storms. Again "the Real Hill Difficulty" is encountered above the
    lake at the "Big Hill" portage and rapids&mdash;one of the sudden descents of this
    alarming stream. Those coming toward Oxford Lake run it at the very risk of their
    lives, but the painful portages impress themselves on all going up the "Height of
    Land," which is reached after passing through a narrow gorge between hills and
    mountains of rocks, the stream dashing headlong down from the mile-long Robinson
    Portage.</p>
    <p>This region is an elevated, rugged waste, with no signs of animal life about it.
    It is the terror of the voyageurs. This eerie tract culminates in the ascending
    "Haute de Terre," as the French call it&mdash;the dividing ridge between the waters
    running eastward to Hudson Bay and those running westward and descending to meet the
    Nelson River, on its headlong way to Hudson Bay as well. The obstacle known as the
    "Painted Stone" being passed the Colonists' brigade was now on its way to the inland
    plain of the Continent.<span class ="pagenum">76</span><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></p>
    <p>The portage led from this string of five small lakes to the head waters of a
    trifling, but very interesting stream called the "Echimamish River." A doubtful but
    curious explanation has been given of the name. On the stream are ten beaver dams;
    which ever of these filled first gave the voyageur the opportunity to launch in his
    canoe or boat and go down the little runway to Black Water Creek. It was said that in
    consequence it was called "Each-a-Man's" brook, according as each voyageur took the
    water with his craft first. The way was now clear, down stream until shortly was seen
    the dashing Nelson River, or as it is here called, "The Sea River." When this was
    accomplished the Immigrants had only to pull stoutly up stream for forty miles or
    more until Norway House, the great Hudson's Bay Fort at the north end of Lake
    Winnipeg was reached.</p>
    <p>The weary journey&mdash;430 miles from York Factory&mdash;was thus over and the
    worn out, weather beaten, ragged, and foot-sore travellers had come to the lake,
    whose name, other than that of Red River, was the only inland word they had ever
    heard of before starting on their journey.</p>
    <p>It was the first standing place in the country, which was now to have them as its
    pioneers.</p>
    <p>There is no turning back now. The Rubicon is crossed. Thirty-seven portages lie
    between<span class ="pagenum">77</span><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a> them and the dissociable
    sea. For better or for worse they will now complete their journey, going on to found
    the Settlement which has become so famous.</p>
    <p>The appearance of Norway House with its fine site and evidences of trade cheered
    the Colonists, and the sight of a body of water like Lake Winnipeg, which can be as
    boisterous as the ocean, brought back the loud resounding sea by whose swishing waves
    most of the settlers, for all their lives, had been lulled to sleep. It is a great
    stormy and dangerous lake&mdash;Lake Winnipeg. But for boats to creep along its shore
    with the liberty of landing on its sloping banks in case of need it is safe enough.
    The season was well past, and haste was needed, but in due time the mouth of the
    river&mdash;the delta of Red River&mdash;was reached. Now they were within forty or
    forty-five miles of their destination. At this time the banks of the Red River were
    well wooded, though there was open grassy plains lying behind these belts of forest.
    There was only one obstruction on their way up the river. This was the "Deer," now
    St. Andrew's Rapids, but after their experiences this was nothing, for these rapids
    were easily overcome by tracking, that is, by dragging the boats by a line up the
    bank.</p>
    <p>Up the river they came and rounded what<span class ="pagenum">78</span><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a> we now call Point Douglas, in the City of Winnipeg, a name
    afterwards given to mark Lord Selkirk's family name. They had completed a journey of
    seven hundred and twenty-eight miles, from York Factory to the site of
    Winnipeg&mdash;and they had done this in fifty-five days. Now they landed.</p>
    <p class="center"><span class="subchap">THE RED LETTER DAY OF THEIR LANDING WAS AUGUST 30TH, 1812.</span></p>
    <p>At York Factory the Colonists had met a Hudson's Bay Company officer&mdash;Peter
    Fidler&mdash;on his way to England. He was the surveyor of the Company and a map of
    the Colony of which a copy is given by us marks the Colony Gardens, where Governor
    Miles Macdonell lived. This spot they chose, and the locality at the foot of Rupert
    Street is marked in the City of Winnipeg. A stone's throw further north along the
    bank of Red River, Fort Douglas was afterwards built, around which circles much of
    this Romantic Settlement Story.</p>
    <p>This spot was the centre of the First Settlement of Rupert's Land and to this
    first party peculiar interest attaches.</p>
    <p>There can only be one Columbus among all the navigators who crossed from Europe to
    America; there can only be one Watt among all the inventors and improvers of the
    steam engine; only one Newton among those who dis<span class ="pagenum">79</span><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>cuss the great discovery of the basal law of gravitation.</p>
    <p>There can be only one first party of those who laid the foundation of collective
    family life in what is now the Province of Manitoba&mdash;and what is wider&mdash;in
    the great Western Canada of to-day. There may have been not many wise men, not many
    mighty, not many noble among them, but the long and stormy voyage which they made,
    the dangers they endured on the sea, the marvellous land journey they accomplished,
    and their taking "seisin of the land," to use William the Conqueror's phrase,
    entitles them to recognition and to respectful memory.<span class ="pagenum">80</span><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></p>

    <p>Pioneering to-day is not so serious a matter as it once was. To the frontiers' man
    now it involves little risk, and little thought, to dispose of his holding, and make
    a dash further West for two or three hundreds of miles across the plains. When he
    wishes more land for his growing sons, he "sells out," fits up his commodious covered
    wagon, called "the prairie schooner," and with implements, supplies, cattle and
    horses, starts on the Western "trail." His wife and children are in high spirits.
    When a running stream or spring is reached on the way he stops and camps. His journey
    taken when the weather is fine and when the mosquitoes are gone is a diversion. The
    writer has seen a family which went through this gypsy-like "moving" no less than
    four times. At length the settler finds his location, has it registered in the
    nearest Land Office and calls it his. With ready axes, the farmer and his sons cut
    down the logs which are to make their dwelling. The children explore the new farm
    lying<span class ="pagenum">81</span><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a> covered with its velvet sod,
    as it has done for centuries; they gather its flowers, pluck its wild fruits, chase
    its wild ducks or grouse or gophers. Health and homely fare make life enjoyable.
    Subject to the incidents and interruptions of every day, which follow humanity, it
    seems to them a continual picnic.</p>
    <p>But how different was the fate of the worn-out Selkirk Colonists. The memory of a
    wretched sea voyage, of a long and dreary winter at Nelson Encampment, and of a
    fifty-five days' journey of constant hardship along the fur traders' route were
    impressed upon their minds. The thought of fierce rivers and the dangers of portage
    and cascade still haunted them, and now everything on the banks of Red River was
    strange. On their arrival the flowers were blooming, but they were prairie flowers,
    and unknown to them. The small Colony houses which they were to occupy would be
    uncomfortable. The very sun in the sky seemed alien to them, for the Highland drizzle
    was seen no more. The days were bright, the weather warm, the nights cool, and there
    was an occasional August thunderstorm, or hailstorm which alarmed them. The traders,
    the Indians, the half-breed trappers, and runners were all new to them. Their Gaelic
    language, which they claimed as that of Eden, was of little value to them except
    where an occasional company-ser<span class ="pagenum">82</span><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>vant chanced to be a countryman of their own. They were without
    money, they were dependent upon Lord Selkirk's agents for shelter and rations. The
    land which they hoped to possess was there awaiting them, but they had no means for
    purchasing implements, nor were the farming requisites to be found in the country.
    Horses there were, but there were only two or three individual cattle within five
    hundred miles of them.</p>
    <p>If they had sung on their sorrowful leaving, "Lochaber no more," the words were
    now turned by their depressed Highland natures into a wail, and they sang in the
    words of their old Psalms of "Rouse's" version:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span class="i0">By Babel's streams we sat and wept,<br />
        </span> <span class="i0">When Zion we thought on.<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>They thought of their crofts and clachans, where if the land was stingy, the gift
    of the sea was at hand to supply abundant food.</p>
    <p>But this was no time for sighs or regrets.</p>
    <p>The Hudson's Bay traders from Brandon House were waiting for expected goods, and
    Messrs. Hillier and Heney, who were the Hudson's Bay Company officers for the East
    Winnipeg District, had arduous duties ahead of them. But though the orders to prepare
    for the Colonists had been sent on in good time,<span class ="pagenum">83</span><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">
  </a> there was not a single bag of pemmican or any other article of
    provision awaiting the hapless settlers. The few French people who were freemen,
    lived in what is now the St. Boniface side of the river, were only living from hand
    to mouth, and the Company's people were little better provided. The river was the
    only resource, and from the scarceness of hooks the supply of fish obtainable was
    rather scanty.</p>
    <p>As the Colonists and their leader were strangers they desired leisure to select a
    suitable location for their buildings. For the time being their camp was at the
    Forks, on the east side of the river, a little north of the mouth of the
    Assiniboine.</p>
    <p>The Governor, Miles Macdonell, on the 4th of September, summoned three of the
    North-West Company gentlemen, the free Canadians beside whom they were encamped, and
    a number of the Indians to a spectacle similar to that enacted by St. Lawson, at
    Sault Ste. Marie, nearly a hundred and fifty years before. The Nor'-Westers had not
    permitted their employees to cross the river. Facing, as he did, Fort Gibraltar,
    across the river, the Governor directed the patent of Lord Selkirk to his vast
    concession to be read, "delivering and seizin were formally taken," and Mr. Heney
    translated some part of the Patent into French for<span class ="pagenum">84</span><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">
  </a> the information of the French Canadians. There was an officers'
    guard under arms; colors were flying and after the reading of the Patent all the
    artillery belonging to Lord Selkirk, as well as that of the Hudson's Bay Company,
    under Mr. Hillier, consisting of six swivel guns, were discharged in a grand
    salute.</p>
    <p>At the close of the ceremony the gentlemen were invited to the Governor's tent,
    and a keg of spirits was turned out for the people.</p>
    <p>Having made such disposition as we shall see of the people, Governor Macdonell
    went with a boat's crew down the river to make a choice of a place of settlement for
    the Colonists. A bull and cow and winter wheat had been brought with the party, and
    these were taken to a spot selected after a three days' thorough investigation of
    both banks of the river for some miles below the Forks. The place found most eligible
    was "an extensive point of land through which fire had run and destroyed the wood,
    there being only burnt wood and weeds left." This was afterwards called Point
    Douglas.</p>
    <p>He had, as we shall see, dispatched the settlers to their wintering place up the
    Red River on the 6th of September, and set some half-dozen men, who were to stay at
    the Forks, to work clearing the ground for sowing winter<span class ="pagenum">85</span><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a> wheat. An officer was left with the men to trade with
    Indians for fish and meat for the support of the workers.</p>
    <p>The winter, which is sharp, crisp and decided in all of Rupert's Land, was
    approaching, so that their situation began to be desperate.</p>
    <p>Governor Macdonell's chief care was for the safety and comfort during the winter
    of his helpless Colonists.</p>
    <p>Sixty miles up the Red River from the Forks was a settlement of native
    people&mdash;chiefly French half-breeds&mdash;and to this place called Pembina came
    in the buffaloes, or if not they were easily reached from this settlement. But the
    poor Scottish settlers had no means of transport, and the way seemed long and
    desolate to them to venture upon, unaccompanied and unhelped. Governor Macdonell did
    his best for them, and succeeded in inducing the Saulteaux Indians, who seemed
    friendly, to guide and protect them as they sought Pembina for winter quarters.</p>
    <p>The Indians had a few ponies and mounted on these they undertook to conduct the
    settlers to their destination. The caravan was grotesquely comical as it departed
    southward. The Indians upon their "Shaganappi ponies," as they are called, like
    mounted guards protecting the men, women and children of the Colony who trudged
    wearily on foot. The Indians were kind<span class ="pagenum">86</span><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">
  </a> to their charge, but the Redman loves a joke, and often indulges in
    "horse-play." The demure Highlander looked unmoved upon the Indian pranks. The
    Indians also hold everything they possess on a loose tenure. The Highlander who was
    forced to surrender the gun, which his father had carried at the battle of Culloden,
    failed to see the humour of the affair, and the Highland woman who was compelled to
    give up her gold marriage ring, because some prairie brave wanted it, was unable to
    see the ethics of the Saulteaux guide who robbed her. The women became very weary of
    their journey, but their mounted guardians only laughed, because they were in the
    habit on their long marches of treating their own squaws in the same manner.</p>
    <p>To Pembina at length they came&mdash;worn out, dusty and despondent. Here they
    erected tents or built huts. The settlers reached Pembina on the 11th of September,
    and Macdonell and an escort of three men, all on horseback, arrived on the 12th.
    Arrived at Pembina Macdonell examined the ground carefully, and selected the point on
    the south side of the Pembina River at its juncture with the Red River as a site for
    a fort. His men immediately camped here. Great quantities of buffalo meat were
    brought in by the French Canadians and Indians. Some of this was sent down to the
    Forks to the party which had remained to built a hut at that point<span class ="pagenum">87</span><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a> for stores. At Pembina a storehouse was built
    immediately, and having given directions to erect several other buildings, the
    Governor returned by boat to the Forks. On the 27th of October Owen Keveny, in charge
    of the second detachment of Colonists, arrived with his party, largely of Irishmen.
    These men were taken on to Pembina. After great activity the buildings were ready by
    the 21st of November to house the whole of the two parties now united in one band of
    Colonists. The Governor and officers' quarters were finished on December 27th.
    Macdonell reports to Lord Selkirk that "as soon as the place at Pembina took some
    form and a decent flagstaff was erected on it, it was called Fort Daer." It is said
    that in most years the buffaloes were very numerous and so tame that they came to the
    Trader's Fort and rubbed their backs upon its stockaded enclosure. There was this
    year plenty of buffalo meat and the Scotch women soon learned to cook it into
    "Rubaboo," or "Rowschow," after the manner of the French half-breeds. Toward spring
    food was scarcer.</p>

    </div>
    <p>In May the winterers of Pembina returned to their settlement at the Colony. They
    sought to begin the cultivation of their farms, but they were helpless. The tough
    prairie sod had to be broken up and worked over, but the only implement which the
    Colonist had to use was a<span class ="pagenum">88</span><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a> simple
    hoe, the one harrow being incomplete. The crofters were poor farmers, for they were
    rather fishermen. But the fish in Red River were scarce in this year, so that even
    the fisher's art which they knew was of little avail to them. The summer of 1813 was
    thus what the old settlers would call an "Off-Year," for even the small fruits on the
    plains<span class ="pagenum">89</span><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a> were far from abundant.
    These being scarce, the chief food of the settlers for all that summer through was
    the "Prairie turnip." This is a variety of the pea family, known as the Astragalus
    esculenta, which with its large taproot grows quite abundantly on the dry plains. An
    old-time trader, who was lost for forty days and only able to get the Prairie turnip,
    practically subsisted in this way. Along with this the settlers gathered quantities
    of a very succulent weed known as "fat-hen," and so were kept alive. The Colonists
    knowing now what the soil could produce obtained small quantities of grain and even
    with their defective means of cultivation, in the next year demonstrated the
    fertility of the soil of the country.</p>
    <p>It was somewhat distressing to the Colonists again in 1813 to make the journey of
    sixty miles to Pembina, trudging along the prairie trail, but there was no other
    resource. The treatment of the Colonists by the "Nor'-Westers" had not thus far been
    unfriendly and the Canadian traders had even imported a few cattle, pigs, and poultry
    for the use of the settlers, and for these favors Governor Macdonell expressed his
    hearty thanks to the Montreal Company. The fatigues and mishaps of the journey to
    Pembina were, however, only the beginning of trouble for the winter. The reception by
    the French half-breed residents of Pembina was<span class ="pagenum">90</span><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">
  </a> not now so friendly as that of the previous winter. At first the
    Nor'-Wester feeling had been one of contempt for the Colonists and pity for them in
    their hunger and miseries. The building of Fort Daer was an evidence of occupation
    that caused the jealous Canadian pioneers to pause. The reception of the second
    season was thus decidedly cool. The struggling settlers found before the winter was
    over that troubles come in troops. Very heavy snows fell in the winter of 1813-14.
    This brought two difficulties. It prevented the buffaloes coming freely from the open
    plains into the rivers and sheltered spots. The buffalo being a heavy animal is
    helpless in the snow. The other difficulty was that the settlers could not go on the
    chase with freedom. Unfortunately the Colonists were not able to use the snowshoe as
    could the lively Metis. The settlers well nigh perished in seeking the camp whither
    the native hunters had gone to follow the buffalo. Indeed the Colonists had the
    conviction that a plot to murder two of their most active leaders was laid by the
    French half-breeds whose sympathies were all with the "Nor'-Westers."</p>
    <p>The climax of feeling was reached when Governor Macdonell, who was with the
    Colonists at Pembina, issued a most unwise proclamation, which to the Nor'-Westers
    seemed an illegality if not an impertinence. Dependent as the set<span class ="pagenum">91</span><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>tlers were on the older Company for supplies and
    assistance this was nothing less than an act of madness.</p>
    <p>By proclamation, on the 8th of January, 1814, Macdonell forbade any traders of
    "The Honorable Hudson's Bay Company, the North-West Company, or any individual or
    unconnected trader whatever to take out any provisions, either of flesh, grain or
    vegetables, from the country.</p>
    <p>The embargo was complete.</p>
    <p>In Governor Macdonell's defence it should be said that he offered to pay by
    British bills for all the provisions taken, at customary rates.</p>
    <p>This assertion of sovereignty set on fire the Nor'-Westers and their
    sympathizers.</p>
    <p>Not only was this extreme step taken, but John Spencer, a subordinate of Macdonell
    was sent west to Brandon House, found an entrance into the North-West Fort at the
    mouth of the Souris River and seizing some twenty-five tons of dry buffalo meat took
    it into his own fort.</p>
    <p>It is quite true that Governor Macdonell expected new bands of Colonists and thus
    justified himself in his seizure. It is to the credit of the Nor'-Westers that they
    restrained themselves and avoided a general conflict, but evidently they only bided
    their time.</p>
    <p>No breach of the peace occurred however,<span class ="pagenum">92</span><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">
  </a> before the return of the Colonists from Pembina to the Colony
    Houses. The settlers occupied their homes in the best of spirits, and began to sow
    their wheat, but they were still greatly checked by the absence of the commonest
    implements of farm culture. Had Lord Selkirk known the true state of things on Red
    River, he would never have continued to send new bands of Colonists so imperfectly
    fitted for dealing with the cultivation of the soil.</p>
    <p>The founder's mind had been fired, both by the opposition of Sir Alexander
    Mackenzie and by the successful arrival of his two bands of Colonists at the Red
    River, to make greater efforts than ever.</p>
    <p>This he did by sending out a third party in all nearly a hundred strong, under the
    leadership of a very capable man&mdash;Archibald Macdonald. This band of settlers in
    1813 were bound on the ship Prince of Wales for York Factory. A very serious attack
    of ship fever filled the whole ship's crew with alarm. Several well-known Colonists
    died. The Captain, alarmed, refused to go on to his destination, but ran the ship
    into Fort Churchill and there disembarked them. Further deaths took place at this
    point. In the spring there was no resource but to trudge over the rocky ledges and
    forbidding desolation of more than a hundred miles between the Fort Churchill and
<span class ="pagenum">93</span><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a> York Factory. Only the stronger
    men and women were selected for the journey. On the 6th of April, 1814, a party of
    twenty-one males and twenty females started on this now celebrated tramp. At first
    the party began to march in single file, but finding this inconvenient changed to six
    abreast. Unaccustomed to snowshoes and sleds the Colonists found the snowy walk very
    distressing. Three fell by the way and were carried on by the stronger men. The
    weather was very cold. A supply of partridges was given them on starting, and the
    party was met by hunters sent from York Factory to meet them, who brought two hundred
    partridges, killed by the way. York Factory was reached on the 13th of April. This
    band of Colonists were superior to any who had come in the former parties. Many of
    them, as we shall see, did not remain in the Colony. A list of this party may be
    found in the Appendix. After remaining a month at York Factory, on the 27th of May,
    this heroic band went on their way to Red River, and reached their destination in
    time to plant potatoes for themselves and others. Comrades left behind at Churchill
    found their way to Red River. Lots along Red River were now being taken up by the
    settlers, and here they sought to found homes under a northern sky. Old and new
    settlers were now hopeful, but their hopes of peace<span class ="pagenum">94</span><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">
  </a> and happiness were soon to be dashed to pieces.</p>
    <p>The arrival of the third year's Colonists provoked still greater opposition.
    Feeling had been gradually rising against the new settlers at every new arrival. The
    excellence of the later immigrants but led their opponents to be irritated.

    </div>
    <p>The year 1815 was a year of world-wide disaster. Napoleon's Europe-shadowing wings
    had for years been over that continent and he like a ravenous bird had left marks of
    his ravages among the most prominent European nations. The world had a breathing
    spell for a short time with Napoleon a virtual prisoner in Elba, but now in March of
    this year he broke from the perch where he had been tethered and all Europe was again
    in terror. The nations were thunderstruck; the alarm was deepened by the appearance
    of Olber's great comet, and in their superstition the ignorant were panic-stricken,
    while the more religious and informed saw in these terrible events the scenes
    pictured in the Apocalypse and maintained that the battle of Armageddon was at hand.
    The epoch-marking battle of Waterloo in June of this year was sufficiently near the
    picture of blood painted in the Revelation to satisfy the credulous.</p>
    <p>But in a remote corner of Rupert's Land,<span class ="pagenum">96</span><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">
  </a> where the number of the combatants was small and the conditions
    exceedingly primitive the comet was alarming enough. The action of Governor Miles
    Macdonell in the beginning of 1814, in forbidding the export of food from Rupert's
    Land and in interfering with the liberty of the traders, Indians and half-breeds, who
    had regarded themselves as outside of law, and as free as the wind of their wild
    prairies, produced an open and out-spoken dissent from every class.</p>
    <p>The Nor'-Westers took time to consider the grave step of interrupting trade which
    Governor Miles Macdonell had taken. Immediate action was impossible. It was four
    hundred miles and more from the Colony to the great emporium of the fur trade on Lake
    Superior. The annual gathering of the Nor'-Westers was held at Grand Portage, the
    terminus of a road nine miles long, built to avoid the rapids of the Pigeon River
    which flows into Lake Superior some thirty or forty miles southwest of where Fort
    William now stands. This concourse was a notable affair. From distant Athabasca, from
    the Saskatchewan, from the Red River and from Lake Winnipeg, the traders gathered in
    their gaily decked canoes, to meet the gentlemen from Montreal, who came to count the
    gains of the year, and lay out plans for the future. Indians gathered outside
<span class ="pagenum">97</span><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a> of Grand Portage Fort. The
    Highland Chieftains were now transformed into factors and traders, and for days they
    met in counsel together. Their evenings were spent in the great dining room of the
    Fort in revelry. Songs of the voyage were sung and as the excitement grew more
    intense the partners would take seats on the floor of the room and each armed with a
    sword or poker or pair of tongs unite in the paddle song of "A la Claire Fontaine,"
    and make merry till far on in the morning. The days were laboriously given to
    business and accounts. When the great MacTavish&mdash;the head of the
    Nor'-Westers&mdash;was there he was often opposed by the younger men, yet he ended
    the strife with his tyrannical will and silenced all opposition.</p>
    <p>The Nor'-Westers at their meeting, July, 1814, under Honorable William
    McGillivray, after whom Fort William was named, decided to oppose the Colony and sent
    two of their most aggressive men to meet force with force, and to give Miles
    Macdonell, the new Dictator, either by arms or by craft, the reward for his tyranny,
    as they regarded it.</p>
    <p>The whole body of the traders were incensed against Lord Selkirk, for had not one
    of the chief Nor'-Wester partners written two years before from London saying, "Lord
    Selkirk must be driven to abandon his project,<span class ="pagenum">98</span><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">
  </a> for his success would strike at the very existence of our
    trade."</p>
    <p>The two men chosen at the gathering in Grand Portage were well fitted for their
    work. Most forward was Alexander Macdonell. On his journey writing to a friend he
    said: "Much is expected of us.... So here is at them with all my heart and energy."
    But the master-mind was his companion Duncan Cameron who, as a leader, stands out in
    the conflicts of the times as a determined man, of great executive ability, but of
    fierce and over-bearing disposition. The Nor'-Westers, having planned bloodshed, all
    agreed that Duncan Cameron was well chosen. He had been a leading explorer and trader
    in the Lake Superior district and knew the fur traders' route as few others did. His
    well-nigh thirty years of service made him a man of outstanding influence in the
    Company. Moreover, he could be bland and jovial. He had the Celtic adroitness. He
    knew how to ingratiate himself with every class and possessed all the devices of an
    envoy. His appearance and dress at Red River were notable. Having had some rank as a
    U.E. Loyalist leader in the war of 1812, he came to the Forks dressed in a scarlet
    military coat with all the accoutrements of a Captain in the Army. He even made
    display of his Captain's Commission by posting it at the gate of Fort Gib<span class ="pagenum">99</span><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>raltar. Of the Fort itself he
    took possession as Bourgeois or master and laid his plans in August, 1814, for the
    destruction of the Selkirk Colony. Cameron then began a systematic course of
    ingratiating himself with the Colonists. Speaking, as he did the Gaelic language, he
    appealed with much success to his countrymen. He represented himself as their friend
    and stirred up the people of Red River against Selkirk tyranny. He pictured to them
    their wrongs, the broken promises of the founder, and the undesirability of remaining
    in the Colony. He brought the settlers freely to his table, treating them openly to
    the beverage of their native country, and completely captured the hearts of a number
    of them. Those, friends of his, he made use of to carry out his deep plans. On the
    very day of the issue of the rations, he induced some of the Colonists to demand the
    nine small cannon in the Colony store houses. The request was refused by Archibald
    Macdonald, the acting Governor. The settlers then went forward, broke open the store
    houses and removed the cannon. Macdonald now arrested the leading settler, who had
    taken the field pieces, whereupon Cameron, like a small Napoleon, incited his clerks
    and men, to invade the Governor's house and release the prisoner. This was done, and
    now it may be said that war between the rival Com<span class ="pagenum">100</span><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>panies
     was declared. On the return of Miles Macdonald, Cameron
    ordered his arrest. Macdonell refused to acknowledge the lawfulness of this action.
    The oily Nor'-Wester Highlander then threatened the people that if the Governor would
    not submit to the law, the whole body of settlers would be dispossessed of their
    farms and driven away from the banks of Red River. As if to make this threat seem
    more real, several loyal settlers were fired at by unseen marksmen.</p>
    <p>Once having begun, Cameron was not the man to hesitate. Another Nor'-Wester plan
    was put into effect.</p>
    <p>Cameron's comrade, Alexander Macdonell, now arrived from the Western plains
    leading it was said, a band of Cree Indians. The Crees are stubborn and determined
    warriors, but they are also crafty. The proposal by Alexander Macdonell ("Yellow Head
    as he was called" to distinguish him), was gravely considered by the Indians. The
    Indians respect authority and in this case they were not very sure who had the
    authority. The Indians declined the offer, and the report proved untrue.</p>
    <p>The Nor'-Westers were, however, strong in their influence over the Chippewas of
    Red Lake in Minnesota. Similar propositions were made to the Sand Lake band of this
    tribe. Though offered a large reward to go on this expedition<span class ="pagenum">101</span><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a> against the Selkirk settlers, the chief refused the
    bribe, and the tribe declined to undertake the enterprise.</p>
    <p>Cameron however, knew the importance of keeping up the war-like spirit of his
    following, and early in June himself took part in an attack upon the Colony houses.
    The affray took place on the edge of the wood near the Governor's residence. Surgeon
    White and Burke the store-keeper, narrowly escaped being killed by the shots fired
    and four of the servants were actually wounded. Cameron like a real operator
    effusively thanked his followers for their grand attack. This state of constant
    hostility, ostensibly on account of the refusal of Governor Macdonell to respect the
    legal summons served upon him, was ended by the surrender of Miles Macdonell, who was
    taken as a prisoner to Montreal, though he was never brought up for trial.</p>
    <p>Thus far Cameron had succeeded in his plans. He was an artful plotter. His capture
    of Miles Macdonell gave him great prestige. Besides, he had roused feelings of
    serious discontent in the minds of nearly all of the Selkirk Colonists. His apparent
    sincerity and kindness to them had also won their hearts. He was now to make the
    greatest move in the game. This was nothing less than a tempting offer to transfer
    the whole of them to the fertile townships<span class ="pagenum">102</span><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">
  </a> of Upper Canada. He provided all the means of transport, he
    promised them free lands in the neighborhood of market towns&mdash;two hundred acres
    to each family. Any wages due to them by Lord Selkirk he would pay and should
    three-quarters of the Colony accept his offer they would have provisions provided for
    a year free of cost. When the poor Colonists thought of the bleak, uncultivated
    country in which they were, of the inevitable hardships which lay before them, and
    saw the dangerous, unsettled state of the Selkirk settlement, they could not well
    resist the offer. Furthermore, the schemer did not stop here. As was afterward found
    out, George Campbell, the arch-agitator and leader among the disaffected settlers
    received a promise of &pound;100, and others of &pound;20 and the like. Further to
    allay their fears it was urged that they were going where the British flag was flying
    and where the truest loyalty prevailed. It was pointed out that it had been to
    prevent any obstacles being raised against their going, that the nine guns had been
    seized and were in the custody of the Nor'-Westers. Accordingly full arrangements
    were made. A supply of canoes was obtained and on the 15th of June, 1815, no less
    than one hundred and forty of the two hundred Colonists on Red River embarked and
    drifted down the river on their long canoe voyage<span class ="pagenum">103</span><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">
  </a> of more than a thousand miles. By the end of July they had gone
    over the dangerous Fur traders' route and passing over four or five hundred miles
    reached Fort William, near Lake Superior. But their journey was not one-half over.
    Along the base of the rugged shores of Lake Superior, through the St. Mary's River,
    down the foaming Sault and then along the shores of Georgian Bay, they paddled their
    way to Penetanguishene. From this point they crossed southward to Holland Landing,
    which is forty miles north of Toronto, and arrived at their destination on the 5th of
    September.</p>
    <p>It is hard to find a parallel for such a journey. They were a large body, made up
    of men, women, and children, continuously journeying for eighty-two days, through an
    unsettled and barren country, running dangerous rapids, and exposed to storms with a
    poorly organized commissariat, and under fear of pursuit by the agents of Lord
    Selkirk, to whom many of them were personally bound. In the township of West
    Gwillinbury, north of Toronto, near London, and in the Talbot settlement, near St.
    Thomas&mdash;all in Upper Canada&mdash;they received their lands. Half a century
    later, in one of the townships north of Toronto, the writer had pointed out to him a
    man named MacBeth weighing two hundred and fifty pounds, of whom it was humourously
    told that he had<span class ="pagenum">104</span><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a> been carried
    all the way from Red River. The explanation of course was, that he had been brought
    as an infant on this famous Hegira of the Selkirk Colonists.</p>
    <p>The finishing of Cameron's work on the Red River, was handed over to Alexander
    Macdonell. The plan was nothing less than that the settlers remaining should be
    driven by force from the banks of Red River. The party led by Macdonell was made up
    of Bois-Brul&eacute;s, under dashing young Cuthbert Grant. On their agile ponies they
    appeared like scourging Huns, to drive out the discouraged remnant of Colonists.</p>
    <p>Each remaining settler was on the 25th of June served with a notice signed by four
    Nor'-Westers, thus:</p>
    <p>"All settlers to retire immediately from Red River, and no trace of a settlement
    to remain." (Signed) Cuthbert Grant, etc.</p>
    <p>Two days after the notice was served the beleaguered settlers, made up of some
    thirteen families&mdash;in all from forty to sixty persons, who had remained true to
    Lord Selkirk and the Colony&mdash;went forth from their homes as sadly as the Acadian
    refugees from Grand Pr&eacute;. They were allowed to take with them such belongings
    as they had, and in boats and other craft went pensively down Red River with Lake
    Winnipeg and Jack River<span class ="pagenum">105</span><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a> in view
    as their destination. The house of the Governor, the mill, and the buildings which
    the settlers had begun to build upon their lots were all set on fire and
    destroyed.</p>
    <p>The U.E. Loyalists of Upper Canada and Nova Scotia draw upon our sympathies in
    their sufferings of hunger and hardship, but they afford no parallel to the
    discouragement, dangers, and dismay of the Selkirk Colonists.</p>
    <p>Alexander Macdonell's party of seventy or eighty mounted men easily carried out
    this work of destruction. There was one fly in the ointment for them. The small
    Hudson's Bay House built by Fidler still remained. Here a daring Celt, John McLeod,
    was in charge. Seeing the temper of Macdonell's levy McLeod determined to fortify his
    rude castle. Beside the trading house of the Hudson's Bay Company stood the
    blacksmith's shop. Hurriedly McLeod, with a cart, carried thither the three-pounder
    cannon in his possession, then cut up lengths of chain to be his shot and shell, used
    with care his small supply of powder and with three or four men, his only garrison,
    stood to his gun and awaited the attack of the Bois-Brul&eacute;s. Being on horseback
    his assailants could not long face his one piece of artillery. It is not known to
    what extent the assailants suffered in the skirmish, but John Warren, a gentleman of
    the Hudson's Bay Company, was<span class ="pagenum">106</span><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">
  </a> killed in the encounter. The siege of McLeod's improvised fort
    continued for several days, but the defence was successful, and McLeod saved for the
    Company &pound;1,000 worth of goods.<span class ="pagenum">107</span><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">

    <div class="subchap">NO SURRENDER.
    </div>
    <p>The crisis has come. The Colony seems to be blotted out. The affair may appear
    small, being nothing more than the defence of the smithy, with one gun and the most
    primitive contrivances, yet as Mercutio says of his wound: "'Tis not so deep as a
    well, nor so wide as a church door; but it is enough."</p>
    <p>The plucky McLeod, with three men held his fort and though the dusky
    Bois-brul&eacute;s on their prairie ponies for a time hovered about yet they did not
    dare to approach the spiteful little field piece. The Metis soon betook themselves
    westward to their own district of Qu'Appelle.</p>
    <p>The danger being over for the present, John McLeod began to restore the Colony
    buildings and even to aim at greater things than had been before.</p>
    <p>One of the most discouraging things in connection with the Selkirk Colony was the
    long sea voyage and the difficult land-journey necessary, not only to gain
    assistance, but even to receive information from the founder in<span class ="pagenum">108</span><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a> Britain for the guidance of the officers in Red
    River settlement. This being the case McLeod could not wait for orders and so as
    being temporarily in charge of the Hudson's Bay Company district at Red River, he
    planned a fort and proceeded at once to build a portion of it. Fortunately across the
    Red River in what is now the town of St. Boniface, he found the freemen who were
    willing to help him. He immediately hired a number of these and began work on the new
    fort.</p>
    <p>Somewhat lower down the Red River than the Colony gardens he selected a site on
    the river banks, now partially fallen in, where George Street at the present days
    ends. Here McLeod began to erect a Governor's House, having confidence that the
    founder would not desert his Colony. Along with this important project, expecting
    that the Colonists would return, he turned his men upon the fields of
    grain&mdash;small, but to them very precious. The yield in this year was good. He
    also erected new fences and cured for the settlers quantities of hay from the swamp
    lands.</p>
    <p>McLeod states in his diary&mdash;of which a copy of the original is in the
    Provincial Library in Winnipeg&mdash;that Fort Douglas was on the south side of Point
    Douglas, so called from Lord Selkirk's family name, and which McLeod has some claim
    to have so christened.<span class ="pagenum">109</span><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a> </p>
    <p>Meanwhile the Colonists had taken their lonely way by boat or canoe, to the foot
    of Lake Winnipeg&mdash;not expecting a speedy delivery. They reached their rendezvous
    in July. Lord Selkirk knew in a general way that his Colony was in danger and so had
    given orders to his faithful officer&mdash;Colin Robertson, who had done yeoman
    service in collecting his first party in Scotland, but who was now in Canada&mdash;to
    engage a number of men and with them proceed to Red River settlement to help his
    Colonists. That the real state of things was not known to Robertson, or the founder,
    appears in the fact that Robertson coming from the East with twenty Canadians, passed
    up the Red River to the Forks to get the first news of the dispersing of the
    Colonists. With his usual dash their rescuer immediately followed the settlers to
    Jack River, found them very much discouraged but persuaded them to return again to
    the banks of the Red River. The work of rebuilding other houses which McLeod had not
    been able to overtake now went on, and there was the greatest anxiety to hear of Lord
    Selkirk's plans.</p>
    <p>The Earl of Selkirk had not become in the slightest degree discouraged. Opposition
    and failure seemed but to inspire him the more. On the return of Miles Macdonell as a
    prisoner to Montreal in the hands of the Nor'-<span class ="pagenum">110</span><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">
  </a> Wester emmissaries, the founder immediately sought for a competent
    successor to Macdonell, and determined to send out the best and strongest party of
    settlers that had yet been gathered.</p>
    <p>He appointed, backed by all the influence of the Hudson's Bay Company, a retired
    officer, Captain Robert Semple. The new Governor was of American origin, born in
    Philadelphia, but had been in the British army. He was a distinctly high-class man,
    though Masson's estimate is probably true&mdash;"A man not very conciliatory, it is
    true, but intelligent, honorable and a man of integrity." He was an author of some
    note, but as it proved, too good or too inexperienced a man for the lawless region to
    which he was sent.</p>
    <p>It would have been almost useless to despatch a new Governor to the Red River
    settlement unless there had also been obtained a number of settlers to fill the place
    of those so skillfully led away by Duncan Cameron. Lord Selkirk now secured the best
    band of Emigrants attainable. These were from a rural parish on the East Coast of
    Sutherlandshire in Scotland. They were from Helmsdale and from the parish of Kildonan
    and the noble founder afterwards conferred this name on their new parish on the banks
    of the Red River. The names of Matheson, Bannerman,<span class ="pagenum">111</span><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a> Sutherland, Polson, Gunn and the like show the
    sturdy character of this band whose descendents are taking their full part in the
    affairs of the Province of Manitoba of to-day. Governor Semple accompanied this party
    of about one hundred settlers, and by way of the Hudson Bay route reached the Red
    River Settlement in the same year in which they started. They joined the restored
    settlers, whom Colin Robertson had placed upon their lands again. With Governor
    Semple's contingent came James Sutherland, an elder of the Church of Scotland, who
    was authorized to baptize and marry. He was the first ordained man who reached the
    Selkirk Colony. The influx of new and old settlers to the Colony, and the imperfect
    preparations made for their shelter and sustenance led to the whole Company betaking
    itself for the winter to Pembina, where at Fort Daer they might be within reach of
    the buffalo herds. Governor Semple accompanied the settlers to Pembina, though
    Alexander Macdonell had charge for the winter. In October of 1815, as the settlers
    were preparing for their winter quarters, the authorities of the Colony thought it
    right to seize Fort Gibraltar, and to retake the field pieces and other property of
    the Colony, which the "Nor'-Westers" had captured. This was done and Duncan Cameron
    who had returned was also taken prisoner.

<span class ="pagenum">112</span><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>
<span class ="pagenum">113</span><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a> Cameron, on his promising to
    keep the peace was almost immediately restored to his liberty and to the command of
    his fort. The feeling, however, all over the country where there were rival Forts was
    not a happy one and gave anxiety to both parties as to the future. After New Year,
    1816, Governor Semple returned from Pembina and counselled with Colin Robertson, as
    to the disturbed state of things. They came to the conclusion that the only safe
    course was to again capture Fort Gibraltar. This they did about April, 1816, and
    again held Cameron as a prisoner. Duncan Cameron was however a dangerous prisoner.
    His ingenuity, courage, and force of character were so great that at any time he
    might be the centre of a movement among the Metis. It was in consequence decided that
    Duncan Cameron should be taken as a captive to England by way of York Factory and be
    tried across seas. Colin Robertson was instructed to conduct him to York Factory. No
    doubt this was a reprisal for the arrest and banishment meted out to Miles Macdonell.
    Cameron was delayed at York Factory on his way to England for more than a year and
    after a short stay in Britain returned to Canada. He afterwards obtained damages of
    &pound;3,000 for his illegal detention.</p>

    <p>But there was future trouble brewing all through the West.<span class ="pagenum">114</span><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a> </p>
    <p>The new Governor, however, unaware of the real state of matters in Rupert's Land
    and probably ignorant of the claim of Canada to the West, and of the force of a
    customary occupation of the land, procured with high-handed zeal a further reprisal.
    Before Colin Robertson had gone to conduct Cameron to York Factory the Governor and
    Robertson had discussed the advisability of dismantling Fort Gibraltar. To this
    course Robertson, knowing the irritation which this would cause to the Nor'-Westers
    strongly objected. For the time the proposal was dropped, but when Robertson had
    gone, then the Governor proceeded with a force of thirty men to pull down Gibraltar,
    which was done in a week. The stockade was taken down, carried to the Red River and
    made into a raft. Upon this was piled the material of the buildings, and the whole
    was floated to the site of Fort Douglas and used in erecting a new structure and
    fully completing the Fort which John McLeod had begun. The same aggressive course was
    pursued under orders from the Governor in regard to Pembina House which was captured,
    its occupants sent as prisoners to Fort Douglas, and its stores confiscated for the
    use of the Colony. The spirit shown by Governor Semple, it is suggested, had
    something of the same treatment as that given to the Colonists by the official
    classes in England against<span class ="pagenum">115</span><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">
  </a> which Edmund Burke burst out with such vehemence in his great
    orations.</p>
    <p>Governor Semple's course would not satisfy Colin Robertson nor would it have been
    approved by Lord Selkirk. The course was his own and fully did he afterwards pay the
    price for his aggressions.</p>
    <p>The last acts of Governor Semple as the report of them was carried westward and
    repeated over the camp fires of the Nor'-Westers and their Bois-brul&eacute;s
    horsemen and voyageurs caused the most violent excitement. The Metis claimed a right
    in the soil from their Indian mothers. The Indian title had never been extinguished
    and afterwards Lord Selkirk found it necessary to make a treaty and satisfy the
    Indian claim. The Nor'-Westers were also by a good number of years the first
    occupants of the Red River district. The Canadian discovery of the West by French
    traders, the daring occupation by Findlay, the Frobishers, Thompson, and Sir
    Alexander Mackenzie all from Montreal even to the Arctic and Pacific Oceans, seemed
    strong to Canadians as against the undefined and shadowy claim to the soil of Lord
    Selkirk and his officers.</p>
    <p>Certain signs of coming trouble might have pressed themselves upon Governor
    Semple. He had eyes but he saw not.</p>
    <p>The Indians, it is true, with their reverence<span class ="pagenum">116</span><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">
  </a> for King George III., and showing their silver medals with the old
    King's face upon them, were disposed to take sides with the British Company. This may
    have confirmed Semple in the tyrannical course he had followed, but had he studied
    the action of the free traders it might have opened his eyes. Just as certain animals
    of the prairie exposed to enemies have an instinctive feeling of coming danger, so
    these denizens of the plains felt the approach of trouble, and with their wives and
    half-breed children betook themselves&mdash;bag and baggage&mdash;to the far Western
    plains where the buffalo runs, and remained there to let the storm blow past, to
    return to the "Forks" in more peaceful times.</p>
    <p>Lord Selkirk, Lady Selkirk, with his Lordship's son and two daughters, were on the
    other hand drawing nearer to the scene of conflict, as they came to Montreal in the
    summer of 1815. In the spring Lord Selkirk started westward to see the vast estate
    which he possessed, but alas! only to see it in the throes of division, of excited
    passion and of bloody conflict, and to face one of the greatest catastrophes of new
    world Colonization.<span class ="pagenum">117</span><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a> </p>

    <div class="subchap">SEVEN OAKS MASSACRE.
    </div>
    <p>Semple's course is on trial. Self-assertion and dictation bring their own penalty
    with them. That so experienced a leader as Colin Robertson, who had been in both
    Companies, who knew the native element, and was acquainted with the daring and
    recklessness of the Nor'-Wester leaders, hesitated about demolishing Fort Gibraltar
    should have given Governor Semple pause. Ignorance and inexperience sometimes give
    men rare courage. But while Semple was self-confident he could not be exonerated from
    paying the price of his rashness.</p>
    <p>Undoubtedly the Governor knew that the "Nor'-Westers" after their aggressiveness
    during the year 1815 were planning an attack upon Fort Douglas and upon the
    Colonists. Letters intercepted by the Governor acquainted him with the fact that an
    expedition was coming from Fort William in the East to fall upon the devoted Colony;
    also a letter from Qu'Appelle written by Cuthbert Grant, the young Bois-<span class ="pagenum">118</span><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>brul&eacute;s leader, to John
    Dugald Cameron, stated that the native horsemen were coming in the spring from the
    Saskatchewan forts to join those of Qu'Appelle, and says the writer, "It is hoped we
    shall come off with flying colors, and never to see any of them again in the
    Colonizing way in Red River."</p>
    <p>The evidence in hand was clear enough to the Governor. He expected the attack, and
    as a soldier he took action from the military standpoint in destroying the enemy's
    base in levelling their Fort Gibraltar. But on the other hand there was no open war.
    The forms of law were being followed by the Nor'-Westers, whose officers were
    magistrates, and who held that by the authorization of the British Parliament the
    administration of justice in the Western Territories was given over to Canada. The
    decision afterwards given in the De Reinhard case in Quebec seems against this
    theory, but this was the popular opinion.</p>
    <p>Thus it came about that among the Hudson's Bay Company fur traders, who were
    somewhat doubtful about Lord Selkirk's movement, and certainly among all the
    "Nor'-Westers," who included the French Canadian voyageur population, Governor
    Semple's action was looked upon as illegal and unjust in destroying Fort Gibraltar
    and appropriating its materials for building up the Colony Headquarters&mdash;Fort
    Douglas.<span class ="pagenum">119</span><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a> </p>
    <p>As the spring opened the wildest rumours of approaching conflict spread through
    the whole fifteen hundred miles of country from Fort William on Lake Superior, to the
    Prairie Fort, where Edmonton now stands on the North Saskatchewan. The excitement was
    especially high in the Qu'Appelle district, some three hundred miles west of Red
    River.</p>
    <p>As the spring of 1815 opened, all eyes were looking to the action of the "New
    Nation" on the Qu'Appelle River as the Bois-brul&eacute;s under Cuthbert Grant called
    themselves. As the whole of these events were afterwards investigated by the law
    courts of Upper Canada, there is substantial agreement about the facts. The first
    violence of the season is described by Lieutenant Pambrun, a most accurate writer. He
    had served in the war of 1812 and gained distinction. On entering the Hudson's Bay
    Company service he was sent to Qu'Appelle district. In order to supply food at Fort
    Douglas Pambrun started down the river to reach the Fort by descending the
    Assiniboine with five boat loads of pemmican and furs. At a landing place in the
    river Pambrun's convoy was surrounded and his goods seized by Cuthbert Grant, Pambrun
    himself being kept for five days as a prisoner. While in custody Pambrun saw every
    evidence of war-like intentions on the part of the half-breeds. Cuthbert Grant fre<span class ="pagenum">120</span><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>quently announced their
    determination to destroy the Selkirk Settlement; in boastful language it was declared
    that the Bois-brul&eacute;s would bow to no authority in Rupert's Land; in their
    gatherings they sang French war-songs to keep up the spirit of their corps. There was
    a ring of growing nationality in all their utterances.</p>
    <p>A start was made late in May for the scene of action. Their prisoner Lieutenant
    Pambrun was taken with them and the captured pemmican was carried along as supplies
    for the journey.</p>
    <p>On the way an episode of some moment occurred. On the river bank a band of Cree
    Indians was encamped.</p>
    <p>Commander Macdonell addressed the redmen through an interpreter to incite them to
    action. A portion of his address was:</p>
    <p>My Friends and Relations,&mdash;"I address you bashfully, for I have not a pipe of
    tobacco to give you.... The English have been spoiling the fair lands which belonged
    to you and the Bois-brul&eacute;s and to which they have no right. They have been
    driving away the buffalo. You will soon be poor and miserable if the English stay.
    But we will drive them away, if the Indian does not, for the 'Nor'-West' Company and
    the Bois-brul&eacute;s are one. If you (turning<span class ="pagenum">121</span><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">
  </a> to the chief) and some of your young men will join I shall be
    glad."</p>
    <p>But the taciturn Indian Chief coldly declined the polite proposal. As the party
    passed Brandon House Pambrun saw in the North-West Fort near by, tobacco, tools and
    furs, which had been captured by the Nor'-Westers from the Hudson's Bay Company fort.
    When Portage la Prairie was reached&mdash;about sixty miles from "The
    Forks"&mdash;the Bois-brul&eacute;s cavalcade was organized.</p>
    <p>The half-breeds were mounted on their prairie steeds and formed a company of sixty
    men under command of Cuthbert Grant. Dressed in their blue capotes and encircled by
    red sashes the men of this irregular cavalry had an imposing effect, especially as
    they were provided with every variety of arms from muskets and pistols down to bows
    and arrows. They were all expert riders and could equal in their feats on horseback
    the fabled Centaurs.</p>
    <p>Down the Portage road which is a prolongation of the great business street of
    Winnipeg running to the West, they came. On the 19th of June, 1816, they had arrived
    within four miles of the Colony headquarters&mdash;Fort Douglas. Here at Boggy Creek,
    called also Cat-Fish Creek, a Council of War was held. Some importance has been
    attached to their action at this point, as showing their motive. That they
<span class ="pagenum">122</span><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a> did not intend to attack Fort
    Douglas has been maintained, else they would not have turned off the Portage Road and
    have crossed the prairie to the Northeast. There is nothing in this contention. The
    plan of campaign was that the Fort William expedition and they were to meet at some
    point on the banks of Red River, before they took further action. Showing how well
    both parties had timed their movements, at this very moment those coming from the
    East under Trader Alexander McLeod, had reached a small tributary of Red River some
    forty miles from Fort Douglas. That they at present wished to avoid Fort Douglas is
    certainly true. Governor Semple and his garrison were on the look-out, and the alarm
    being given, the party from the Fort sallied forth. Was it to parley? or to
    fight?</p>
    <p>The events which followed are well told in the evidence given by Mr. John
    Pritchard, who afterwards acted as Lord Selkirk's secretary. Mr. Pritchard was the
    grandfather of the present Archbishop Matheson of Rupert's Land. His evidence has
    been in almost every respect corroborated by other eye-witnesses of this bloody
    event:</p>
    <p>"On the evening of the 19th of June, 1816, I had been upstairs in my own room, in
    Fort Douglas, and about six o'clock I heard the boy at the watch house give the alarm
    that the<span class ="pagenum">123</span><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a> Bois-brul&eacute;s
    were coming. A few of us, among whom was Governor Semple&mdash;there were perhaps six
    altogether&mdash;looked through a spyglass, from a place that had been used as a
    stable, and we distinctly saw armed persons going along the plains. Shortly after, I
    heard the same boy call out, that the party on horseback were making to the
    settlers."</p>
    <p>"About twenty of us, in obedience to the Governor," who said, 'We must go and see
    what these people are,' took our arms. He could only let about twenty go, at least he
    told about twenty to follow him, to come with him; there was, however, some confusion
    at the time, and I believe a few more than twenty accompanied us. Having proceeded
    about half a mile towards the settlement, we saw, behind a point of wood which goes
    down to the river, that the party increased very much. Mr. Semple, therefore, sent
    one of the people (Mr. Burke) to the Fort for a piece of cannon and as many men as
    Mr. Miles Macdonell could spare. Mr. Burke, however, not returning soon, Governor
    Semple said, 'Gentlemen, we had better go on, and we accordingly proceeded. We had
    not gone far before we saw the Bois-brul&eacute;s returning towards us, and they
    divided into two parties, and surrounded us in the shape of a half-moon or
    half-circle. On our way, we met a number of the settlers crying, and speaking in the
    Gaelic language, which I do not understand, and they went on to the Fort. went on to
    the Fort.<br />

    <p>"The party on horseback had got pretty near to us, so that we could discover that
    they were painted and disguised in the most hideous manner; upon this, as they were
    retreating, a Frenchman named Boucher advanced, waving his hand, riding up to us, and
    calling out in broken English, 'What do you want? What do you want?' Governor Semple
    said. 'What do <i>you</i> want?' Mr. Burke not coming on with the cannon as soon as
    he was expected, the Governor directed the party to proceed onwards; we had not gone
    far before we saw the Bois-brul&eacute;s returning upon us.</p>
    <p>"Upon observing that they were so numerous, we had extended our line, and got more
    into the open plain; as they advanced, we retreated; but they divided themselves into
    two parties, and surrounded us again in the shape of a half-moon."</p>
    <p>"Boucher then came out of the ranks of his party, and advanced towards us (he was
    on horseback), calling out in broken English, 'What do you want? What do you want?'
    Governor Semple answered, 'What do <i>you</i> want?' To which Boucher answered, 'We
    want our Fort.' The Governor said, 'Well, go to your Fort.' After that I did not hear
    anything that passed, as they were close together. I saw the<span class ="pagenum">126</span><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a> Governor putting his hand on Boucher's gun.
    Expecting an attack to be made instantly, I had not been looking at Governor Semple
    and Boucher for some time; but just then I happened to turn my head that way, and
    immediately I heard a shot, and directly afterwards a general firing. I turned round
    upon hearing the shot, and saw Mr. Holte, one of our officers, struggling as if he
    were shot. He was on the ground. On their approach, as I have said, we had extended
    our line on the plain, by each taking a place at a greater distance from the other.
    This had been done by the Governor's orders, and we each took such places as best
    suited our individual safety.</p>
    <p>"From not seeing the firing begin, I cannot say from whom it first came; but
    immediately upon hearing the first shot, I turned and saw Lieut. Holte struggling."
    (Several persons present at the affair, such as a blacksmith named Heden, and McKay,
    a settler, distinctly state that the first shot fired was from the Bois-brul&eacute;s
    and that by it Lieut. Holte fell).</p>
    <p>"As to our attacking our assailants, one of our people, Bruin, I believe, did
    propose that we should keep them off; and the Governor turned round and asked who
    could be such a rascal as to make such a proposition? and that he should hear no word
    of that kind again. The Governor was very much displeased indeed at
<span class ="pagenum">127</span><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a> the suggestion made. A fire was
    kept up for several minutes after the first shot, and I saw a number wounded; indeed,
    in a few minutes almost all our people were either killed or wounded. I saw Sinclair
    and Bruin fall, either wounded or killed; and a Mr. McLean, a little in front
    defending himself, but by a second shot I saw him fall.</p>
    <p>"At this time I saw Captain Rodgers getting up again, but not observing any of our
    people standing, I called out to him, 'Rodgers, for God's sake give yourself up! Give
    yourself up!' Captain Rodgers ran toward them, calling out in English and in broken
    French, that he surrendered, and that he gave himself up, and praying them to save
    his life. Thomas McKay, a Bois-brul&eacute;s, shot him through the head, and another
    Bois-brul&eacute;s dashed upon him with a knife, using the most horrid imprecations
    to him. I did not see the Governor fall. I saw his corpse the next day at the Fort.
    When I saw Captain Rodgers fall, I expected to share his fate. As there was a
    French-Canadian among those who surrounded me, who had just made an end of my friend,
    I said, 'Lavigne, you are a Frenchman, you are a man, you are a Christian. For God's
    sake save my life! For God's sake try and save it! I give myself up; I am your
    prisoner.' McKay, who was among this party, and who knew me, said, 'You little toad,
    what do you do here?'<span class ="pagenum">128</span><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a> He spoke
    in French, and called me 'un petit crapaud,' and asked what I did here! I fully
    expected then to lose my life. I again appealed to Lavigne, and he joined in
    entreating them to spare me. I told them over and over again that I was their
    prisoner, and I had something to tell them. They, however, seemed determined to take
    my life. They struck at me with their guns, and Lavigne caught some of the blows, and
    joined me in entreating for my safety. He told them of my kindness on different
    occasions. I remonstrated that I had thrown down my arms and was at their mercy. One
    Primeau wished to shoot me; he said I had formerly killed his brother. I begged him
    to recollect my former kindness to him at Qu'Appelle. At length they spared me,
    telling me I was a little dog, and had not long to live, and that he (Primeau) would
    find me when he came back.</p>
    <p>"Then I went to Frog Plain (Kildonan), in charge of Boucher. In going to the plain
    I was again threatened by one of the party, and saved by Boucher, who conducted me
    safely to Frog Plain. I there saw Cuthbert Grant, who told me that they did not
    expect to have met us on the plain, but that their intention was to have surprised
    the Colony, and that they would have hunted the Colonists like buffaloes. He also
    told me they expected to have got round unperceived, and at night would have sur<span class ="pagenum">129</span><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>rounded the Fort and have shot
    everyone who left it; but being seen, their scheme had been destroyed or frustrated.
    They were all painted and disfigured so that I did not know many. I should not have
    known that Cuthbert Grant was there, though I knew him well, had he not spoken to
    me."</p>
    <p>"Grant told me that Governor Semple was not mortally wounded by the shot he
    received, but that his thigh was broken. He said that he spoke to the Governor after
    he was wounded, and had been asked by him to have him taken to the Fort, and as he
    was not mortally wounded he thought he might perhaps live. Grant said he could not
    take him himself as he had something else to do, but that he would send some person
    to convey him on whom he might depend, and that he left him in charge of a
    French-Canadian and went away; but that almost directly after he had left him, an
    Indian, who, he said, was the only rascal they had, came up and shot him in the
    breast, and killed him on the spot.</p>
    <p>"The Bois-brul&eacute;s, who very seldom paint or disguise themselves, were on
    this occasion painted as I have been accustomed to see the Indians at their
    war-dance; they were very much painted, and disguised in a hideous manner. They gave
    the war-whoop when they met Governor Semple and his party; they made a hideous noise
    and shouting. I know from Grant,<span class ="pagenum">130</span><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">
  </a> as well as from other Bois-brul&eacute;s, and other settlers, that
    some of the Colonists had been taken prisoners. Grant told me that they were taken to
    weaken the Colony, and prevent its being known that they were there&mdash;they having
    supposed that they had passed the Fort unobserved.</p>
    <p>"Their intention clearly was to pass the Fort. I saw no carts, though I heard they
    had carts with them. I saw about five of the settlers prisoners in the camp at Frog
    Plain. Grant said to me further: 'You see we have had but one of our people killed,
    and how little quarter we have given you. Now, if Fort Douglas is not given up with
    all the public property instantly and without resistance, man, women and child will
    be put to death.' He said the attack would be made upon it that night, and if a
    single shot were fired, that would be a signal for the indiscriminate destruction of
    every soul. I was completely satisfied myself that the whole would be destroyed, and
    I besought Grant, whom I knew, to suggest or let them try and devise some means to
    save the women and children. I represented to him that they could have done no harm
    to anybody, whatever he or his party might think the men had. I entreated him to take
    compassion on them. I reminded him that they were his father's country-women and in
    his deceased father's name, I begged him to take pity and compassion on them and
    spare them.<span class ="pagenum">131</span><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a> </p>
    <p>At last he said, if all the arms and public property were given up, we should be
    allowed to go away. After inducing the Bois-brul&eacute;s to allow me to go to Fort
    Douglas, I met our people; they were long unwilling to give up, but at last our Mr.
    Macdonell, who was now in charge consented. We went together to the Frog Plain, and
    an inventory of the property was taken when we had returned to the Fort. The Fort was
    delivered over to Cuthbert Grant, who gave receipts on each sheet of the inventory
    signed 'Cuthbert Grant, acting for the North-West Company.' I remained at Fort
    Douglas till the evening of the 22nd, when all proceeded down the river&mdash;the
    settlers, a second time on their journey into exile.</p>
    <p>"The Colonists, it is true, had little now to leave. They were generally employed
    in agricultural pursuits, in attending to their farms, and the servants of the
    Hudson's Bay Company in their ordinary avocations. They lived in tents or in huts. In
    1816 at Red River there was but one residence, the Governor's which was in Fort
    Douglas. The settlers had lived in houses previous to 1815, but in that year these
    had been burnt in the attack that had been made upon them. The settlers were employed
    during the day time on their land, and used to come up to the Fort to sleep in some
    of the buildings in the enclosure. All was now left behind. The<span class ="pagenum">132</span><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a> Bois-brul&eacute;s victory being now complete, the
    messenger was despatched Westward to tell the news far and near."<span class ="pagenum">133</span><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></p>

    <div class="subchap">AFTERCLAPS.
    </div>
    <p>The Seven Oaks affair was the most shocking episode that ever occurred in
    North-Western history. The standing of the victims, including a Governor appointed by
    the Hudson's Bay Company, his staff men of position, the unexpectedness of the
    collision, the suddenness of the attack, the destruction of life, the cruelty and
    injustice of the killing, and the barbarous treatment of the bodies of the dead, by
    the Bois-brul&eacute;s war party, fill one with horror, and remind one of scenes of
    butchery in dark Africa or the isles of the South Sea.</p>
    <p>This is the more remarkable when it is considered that so far as known in the
    whole two hundred years and more of the career of the Hudson's Bay and Nor'-Wester
    Companies not so many officers and clerks of these two Companies have altogether
    perished by violence as in this unfortunate Seven Oaks disaster. No sooner was the
    massacre over than the Bois-brul&eacute;s took possession of Fort Douglas and were
    under the command meantime of Cuth<span class ="pagenum">134</span><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>bert Grant. There was the greatest hilarity among the Metis. This
    New Nation had been vindicated. About forty-five men under arms held possession of
    the Fort. The dead left upon the field were still exposed there days after the fight
    and were torn to pieces by the wild birds and beasts. The body of Governor Semple was
    carried to the Fort.</p>
    <p>Word was meanwhile sent to Alexander Macdonell the partner who had brought with
    him the Qu'Appelle contingent and had waited at Portage la Prairie while Cuthbert
    Grant with his followers, chiefly disguised as Indians, had gone on their bloody
    work. Macdonell on receiving the news showed great satisfaction. He announced to
    those about him that Governor Semple and five of his officers had been killed; and
    becoming more enthusiastic shouted with an oath in French that twenty-two of the
    English were slain. His company shouted with joy at his announcement. Macdonell then
    went to Fort Douglas and took command of it. But what had become of the Eastern
    Company from Fort William? Of this a discharged non-commissioned officer, Huerter, of
    one of the mercenary regiments which had fought for Britain against the Americans in
    the War of 1812 was with them, and gives a good account of the journey. We need only
    deal with the ending of the expedition. Coming from Lake<span class ="pagenum">135</span><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a> Winnipeg they reached Nettly Creek two days after
    the fight at Seven Oaks, expecting there to get news from the Western levy and
    Alexander Macdonell. But no news of that Company having reached them they started in
    boats up the Red River to reach the rendezvous agreed on at "Frog Plain," the spot
    where Kildonan church stands to-day. From this point they expected to meet with their
    Western reinforcement, and to move upon Fort Douglas and capture it, as Governor
    Semple had done with Fort Gibraltar. Their commander Archibald Norman McLeod was the
    senior officer and would later take command.</p>
    <p>They had on the 23rd of June gone but a little way when they were surprised to
    meet seven or eight boats laden with men, women and children. These were the fragment
    of the Colony which had refused to go with Duncan Cameron down to Upper Canada. They
    had been sheltered in the Fort during the time of the fight and now were rudely
    driven away from the settlement, according to the announcement of Cuthbert Grant.</p>
    <p>McLeod ordered the convoy of boats to stop and the Colonists to disembark. Their
    boxes and packages were opened, including the late Governor Semple's trunks, and
    examined for papers or letters which might give important information to the captors.
    The Western levy<span class ="pagenum">136</span><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a> now joined
    them, and gave them full news of what had happened.</p>
    <p>The Colonists were then ordered to re-embark and to proceed upon their journey to
    their lonely place of banishment whither they had gone the previous year&mdash;Jack
    River, near Norway House. One of the Bois-brul&eacute;s followed after them to make
    sure that they went upon their long voyage. McLeod's party then pushed on with great
    glee to Fort Douglas and were received with discharges of artillery and firearms.
    McLeod now took command of the captured Fort.</p>
    <p>Huerter, the discharged soldier, formerly mentioned, went to the field of Seven
    Oaks about a week after the fight and confirmed Pambrun's account.</p>
    <p>A.N. McLeod now became the superior officer in the Fort and made preparation for
    defending it. He himself occupied the late Governor Semple's quarters and passed out
    compliments to white and native alike, praising them for their daring, their
    adroitness and their success. A great meeting was then gathered in the Governor's
    apartments and a levee was held at which all of the servants and employees of the
    Company were present, and in a speech McLeod told the audience that the English had
    no right to build upon their lands without their permission&mdash;a new doctrine
    surely.<span class ="pagenum">137</span><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a> </p>
    <p>Leaving Fort Douglas McLeod with his officers and the Bois-brul&eacute;s all
    mounted, made an imposing procession up to the site of old Fort Gibraltar. Here
    Peguis, now the chief of the Saulteaux who had shown such kindness to the settlers
    was camped, and to him and his followers McLeod showed his great displeasure. The
    Indian always loved the British-man, whom on the west coast he called, "King
    Shautshman," or King George's man.</p>
    <p>The Indian is taciturn, unemotional, and cautious. He knew that the
    Bois-brul&eacute;s had assumed their garb and committed the outrage of Seven Oaks,
    and therefore the tribe were unwilling to be under the stigma being thrown upon them.
    When McLeod had failed in his appeal, he laid many sins to their charge. They had
    allowed the English to carry away Duncan Cameron to Hudson Bay, they were a band of
    dogs, and he would count them always as his enemies if they should hold to their
    English friends. Peguis, who was a master diplomat, looked on with attention and held
    his peace.</p>
    <p>It was now about a week from the time of the massacre. Huerter, the discharged
    soldier spoken of, rode down with a party from the Fort to the field of Seven Oaks.
    He saw a number of human bodies scattered on the plain, and in most cases the flesh
    had been torn off to the bone, evidently by dogs and wolves.<span class ="pagenum">138</span><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a> </p>
    <p>Far from discouraging the talkative half-breeds, whose blood was up with the
    sights of carnage, McLeod and his fellow-officers expressed their approbation of the
    deeds done, and the Bois-brul&eacute;s became boisterous in detailing their
    victories. The worst of the whole, old Deschamps, a French-Canadian, who murdered the
    disabled even when they cried for quarter, drew forth as he detailed his valorous
    actions to Alexander Macdonell, the exclamation, "What a fine, vigorous old man he
    is!" On the evening of this Red-letter day of the visit to the Indian encampment and
    to Seven Oaks, a wild and heathenish orgy took place. The Bois-brul&eacute;s bedecked
    their naked bodies with Indian trinkets and executed the dance of victory, as had
    done their savage ancestors. The effect of these dances is marvellous. By a
    contagious shout they excite each other. They reach a frenzy which communicates
    itself with hypnotic effect to the whole dancing circle. At times men tear their
    hair, cut their flesh or even mutilate their limbs for life. The "tom-tom," or Indian
    drum, adds to the power of monotonous rhythm and to the spirit of excitement and
    frenzy.</p>
    <p>To the partners McLeod and the others, however much in earnest the actors might
    be, it afforded much amusement, and gave hope of a strength and enthusiasm that would
    bind them fast to the "Nor'-Wester" side.<span class ="pagenum">139</span><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">

    <p>The struggle over and the battle won, while leaving the garrison sufficient to
    hold the fort, ten days after the fight the partners and those forming the Northern
    brigade, who were to penetrate to the wilds to Athabasca, departed. They were
    following down the Red River and Lake Winnipeg, in the very path which the fleeing
    Colonists had gone, but they would turn toward the "Grand Rapids" at the spot where
    the great river of the West pours into Lake Winnipeg, and by this way speed
    themselves to the great hunting fields of the North. The departure of what was called
    the Grand Brigade was signalized by an artillery salute from Fort Douglas, which
    resounded through the wretched ruins of the houses burnt the previous year, and over
    the fields deserted by the Colonists and left to the chattering blackbird and the
    howling wolf. Almost every race of people&mdash;however small&mdash;has its bard.
    Among the Bois-brul&eacute;s was the son of old Pierre Falcon, a French-Canadian, of
    some influence among the natives. This young poet was a character. He had the French
    vivacity, the prejudice of race, the devotion to the Scotch Fur Company and a
    considerable rhyming talent. Many years after Pierre Falcon won the admiration of the
    buffalo hunter and was the friend of all the dusky maidens who followed his song of
    love or war alike. He it was who sang<span class ="pagenum">140</span><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">
  </a> the song of his race and helped to keep up the love of fun among
    the French people of the Red River. It was reminiscent of victory and also a forecast
    of future influence and power. Various versions of Pierre Falcon's song have come
    down to us celebrating the victory of Seven Oaks. We give a simple translation of the
    bard's effusion:</p>

    <div class="subchap">THE SILVER CHIEF ARRIVES.
    </div>
    <p>The scene changes to the home of the founder of the Colony. The Earl of Selkirk is
    living at his interesting seat&mdash;St. Mary's Isle, and letter after letter arrives
    which has taken many weeks on the road, coming down through trackless prairie, across
    the middle and Eastern States of America and reaching him via New York. These letters
    continue to increase in being more and more terrible until his island home seems to
    be in a state of siege.</p>
    <p>St. Mary's Isle lies at the mouth of the Dee on Solway Frith, opposite the town of
    Kirkcudbright. Here in 1778 Paul Jones, the so-called pirate in the employ of the
    Revolutionary Government in America, had landed, invested the dwelling with his men,
    and carried away all the plate and jewels of the House of Selkirk. The Old Manor
    House of St. Mary's Isle, with its very thick stone wall on one side, evidently had
    been a keep or castle. It was at one time given to the church and became a monastery,
    then it was enlarged and im<span class ="pagenum">143</span><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>proved to become the dwelling of the family of the Douglasses,
    which it is to this day.</p>
    <p>But now the far cry from Red River reverberated across the Atlantic. The startling
    succession of events of 1815 reached the Earl one after another. It was late in the
    year when he made up his mind, but taking his Countess, his two daughters and his
    only son, Dunbar, a mere boy, and crossing the ocean he heard, on his arrival in New
    York, of the complete destruction by flight and expulsion of the people of his
    Colony. About the end of October he reached Montreal, but winter was too near to
    allow him to travel up the lakes and through the wilds to Red River.</p>
    <p>The winter in Montreal was long, but the atmosphere of opposition to Lord Selkirk
    in that city, the home of the Nor'-Westers, was more trying to him than the frost and
    snow. His every movement was watched. Even the avenues of Government power seemed by
    influential Nor'-Westers to be closed against him. An appeal to Sir Gordon Drummond,
    the Governor-General, could obtain no more than a promise of a Sergeant and six men
    to protect him personally should he go to the far West, and the appointment of
    himself as a Justice of the Peace in Upper Canada and the Indian Territory was
    grudgingly given.</p>
    <p>The active mind of his Lordship occupied the<span class ="pagenum">144</span><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">
  </a> time of winter well. He planned nothing less than introducing to
    the banks of Red River a body of men as settlers, who could, like the returned exiles
    to Jerusalem, work with sword in one hand and a tool of industry in the other. The
    man of resource finds his material ready made. Two mercenary regiments from
    Switzerland which had been fighting England's battles in America had just been
    disbanded, and Lord Selkirk at once engaged them to go as settlers, under his pay, to
    Red River. From the commanding officer of the larger regiment these have always been
    called the "De Meurons." From these two regiments&mdash;one at Montreal and the other
    at Kingston&mdash;he engaged an hundred men, each provided with a musket, and with
    rather more than that number of expert voyageurs started in June 16th, 1816, for the
    North-West. The route followed by him was up Lake Ontario to Toronto, then across
    country to Georgian Bay and through it to Ste. Sault Marie. At Drummond Island, being
    the last British garrison toward the West, he got from the Indians news of the
    efforts of the Nor'-Westers to involve them in the wars of the whites. The Indians
    had, however, resisted all their temptations. Lord Selkirk again overtook his party
    and passed through the St. Mary's River into Lake Superior.</p>
    <p>Here a new grief awaited him.<span class ="pagenum">145</span><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">
  </a> </p>
    <p>Two canoes coming from Fort William brought him the sad news about Governor Semple
    and his party being killed at Seven Oaks, as it did also of the second expulsion of
    the Colonists. Lord Selkirk had been intending to go west to where Duluth now stands
    and then overland to the Red River.</p>
    <p>He now changed his plans and with true Scottish pluck headed directly to Fort
    William. Here assaults, arrests and imprisonments took place. It is needless for us
    to give the details of this unfortunate affair, except to say that the seizure of the
    Fort brought much trouble afterwards to the founder.</p>
    <p>Moving some miles up the Kaministiquia River Lord Selkirk made his military
    encampment, which bore the name of "Pointe De Meuron."</p>
    <p>Plans were soon made for the spring attack on Fort Douglas.</p>
    <p>In March, stealthily crossing the silent pathways for upwards of four hundred
    miles and striking the Red River some where near the international boundary line, the
    De Meurons came northward and made a circuit towards Silver Heights. There, having
    constructed ladders, they next made a night attack on Fort Douglas, and being trained
    soldiers easily captured it, and restored it to its rightful owner, Lord Selkirk.
<span class ="pagenum">146</span><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a> </p>
    <p>On May day, 1817, Lord Selkirk, with his body guard, left Fort William and
    following the water-courses arrived at his own Fort in the last week of June. Fort
    Douglas was the centre of his Colony, and there he was at once the chief figure of
    the picture.</p>
    <p>None of the Selkirk Settlers' descendants who are living to-day saw him in Fort
    Douglas, but a number who have passed away have told the writer that they remembered
    him well. He was tall in stature, thin and refined in appearance. He had a benignant
    face, his manner was easy and polite. To the Indians he was especially interesting.
    They caught the idea that being a man of title he was in some way closely connected
    with their Great Father the King. Because of his generosity to them in making a
    treaty, they called him "The Silver Chief." He was the source of their treaty
    money.</p>
    <p>It is said that some of the last party to reach his Colony had seen him at
    Kildonan in Scotland, where he had visited them, and encouraged them in their
    departure for the Colony.</p>
    <p>His first duties were to the unfortunate settlers, who had been brought back from
    Jack River.</p>
    <p>Lord Selkirk gathered the Colonists on the spot where the church and burial ground
    of St. John's are still found. "The Parish," said he, "shall be Kildonan. Here you
    shall build your<span class ="pagenum">147</span><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a> church, and
    that lot," he said, pointing to the lot across the little stream called Parsonage
    Creek, "is for a school." He was thus planning to carry out the devout imagination of
    the greatest religious leader of his nation, John Knox: "A church and a school for
    every parish."</p>
    <p>Perhaps the most interesting episode in Lord Selkirk's visit was his treaty-making
    with the Indians. The plan of securing a strip of land on each side of the river was
    said to have been decided to be as much as could be seen by looking under the belly
    of a horse out upon the prairie. This was about two miles. Hence the river lots were
    generally about two miles long.</p>
    <p>His meeting with the Indians was after the manner of a great "Pow-wow." The
    Indians are fluent and eloquent speakers, though they indulge in endless
    repetitions.</p>
    <p>Peguis, the Saulteaux chief, befriended the white man from the beginning. He
    denounced the Bois-brul&eacute;s. He said, "We do not acknowledge these men as an
    independent tribe."</p>
    <p>"L'Homme Noir," the Assiniboine chief, among other things, said: "We have often
    been told you were our enemy, but we hear from your own mouth the words of a true
    friend."</p>
    <p>"Robe Noire," the Chippewa, tried in lofty style to declare: "Clouds have over-<span class ="pagenum">148</span><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>whelmed me. I was a long time
    in doubt and difficulty, but now I begin to see clearly."</p>
    <p>While Lord Selkirk was still in his Colony, the very serious state of things on
    the banks of Red River and the pressure of the British Government led to the
    appointment, by the Governor-General of Canada, of a most clear-minded and
    peace-loving man as Commissioner. This appointment was all the more pleasing on
    account of Mr. W.B. Coltman being a resident Canadian of Quebec. Coltman was one man
    among a thousand. He was patient and kind and just. Though he had come to the Colony
    prejudiced against Lord Selkirk, he found his Lordship so fair and reasonable that he
    became much attached to the man represented in Montreal and the far East as a
    destructive ogre.</p>
    <p>The Commissioner's report covered one hundred pages, and it was in all respects a
    model. He thoroughly understood the motives of both parties, and his decisions led to
    a perfect era of peace, and moreover in the end to the union of the Hudson's Bay and
    Nor'-West Companies.</p>
    <p>Lord Selkirk's coming was like a ray of sunshine to the Colonists of Red River.
    Being of an intensely religious disposition, the people reminded him afterwards that
    the elder who came out in 1815, who was able to baptize and marry, had been carried
    away by main force by the Nor'-Westers to Canada in 1818, so that they were
<span class ="pagenum">149</span><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a> without religious services.
    They always continued to have prayer meetings and to keep up the pious customs of
    their fathers. This practise long survived among them. In repeating his promise of a
    clergyman, Lord Selkirk asserted to them: "Selkirk never forfeited his word."</p>
    <p>His work done among his Colonists, he left them never to see them again. He went
    south from Fort Douglas to the United States, visited, it is said, St. Louis, came to
    the Eastern States, and rejoined in Montreal his Countess and children who had in his
    absence lived in great anxiety. One of his daughters, afterwards Lady Isabella Hope,
    told the writer nearly thirty years ago that she as a girl remembered seeing Lord
    Selkirk as he returned from this long journey, coming around the Island into Montreal
    Harbor paddled by French voyageurs in swift canoes to his destination. His attention
    was immediately given to law suits and actions brought against him in the courts of
    Upper Canada. These legal conflicts originated from the troubles about the two
    centres&mdash;Fort Douglas and Fort William&mdash;where the collisions had taken
    place. The influence of the Nor'-Westers in Montreal was so great that the U.E.
    Loyalists of Upper Canada sympathised with them against the noble philanthropist.
    Justice was undoubtedly perverted in Upper Canada in the<span class ="pagenum">150</span><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a> most shameless way. Weak in body at the best, Lord
    Selkirk by his misfortunes, losses and legal persecution began to fail in health.
    With the sense of having been unjustly defeated, and anxious about his Colonists in
    Red River, he returned with his family to Britain to his beloved St. Mary's Isle. He
    sought for justice from the British Parliament, but could there get no movement in
    his favor. A copy of a letter to him from Sir Walter Scott, his old friend, is in the
    hands of the writer, but Sir Walter was himself too ill at the time to lend him aid
    in presenting his case before the British public. Heart-broken, he gave up the
    struggle. With the Countess and his family he went to the South of France and died on
    April 8th, 1820, at Pau, and his bones lie in the Protestant Cemetery of Orthes.</p>
    <p>He had not fought in vain. He had broken down single-handed a system of organized
    terrorism in the heart of North America, for the Nor'-Westers never rose to strength
    again. They united in a few years with the Hudson's Bay Company. He established a
    Colony that has thriven; he cherished a lofty vision; he made mistakes in action, in
    judgment, and in a too great optimism, but if we understand him aright he bore an
    untainted and resolute soul.</p>

    <div class="subchap">SOLDIERS AND SWISS.
    </div>
    <p>Many Canadian Settlements have had a military origin. It was considered a wise,
    strategic move in the game of national defence when Colonel Butler and his Rangers,
    after the Treaty of Paris, were settled along the Niagara frontier, and when Captain
    Grass and other United Empire Loyalists took up their holdings at Kingston and other
    points on the boundary line along the St. Lawrence. The town of Perth was the
    headquarters of a military settlement in Central Canada. Traces of military
    occupation can still be found in such Highland districts of Canada as Pictou,
    Glengarry and Zorra, in which last named township the enthusiastic Celt in 1866
    declared that perhaps the Fenians would take Canada, but they could never take Zorra.
    Numerous examples can be found all through Canada where there is an aroma of valor
    and patriotism surrounding the old army officer or the families of the veterans of
    the Napoleonic or Crimean wars.</p>
    <p>The settlement of the De Meuron soldiers<span class ="pagenum">153</span><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">
  </a> opposite Fort Douglas gave some promise of a military flavor to
    Selkirk Settlement. But as we shall see it was an ill-advised attempt at
    colonization. It was a mistake to settle some hundred or more single men as these
    soldiers were without a woman among them, as Lord Selkirk was compelled to do. To
    these soldier-colonists he gave lands along the small winding river now called the
    Seine, which empties into Red River opposite Point Douglas. Many of the De Meurons
    spoke German, and hence for several years the little stream on which they lived was
    called German Creek. The writings of the time are full of rather severe criticism of
    these bello-agricultural settlers. Of course no one expects an old soldier to be of
    much use to a new country. He is usually a lazy settler. His habits of life are
    formed in another mould from that of the farm. He is apt to despise the hoe and the
    harrow and many even of the half-pay officers who came to hew out a home in the
    Canadian forest, never learned to cut down a tree or to hold a plough, though it may
    be admitted that they lived a useful life in their sons and daughters, while the
    culture and decision of character of the old officer or sturdy veteran were an asset
    of great value to the locality in which he settled.</p>
    <p>But the De Meurons were not only bachelors, but they came from the peasantry of
    Austria<span class ="pagenum">154</span><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a> and Italy, they had not
    fought for home and country, and their life of mercenary soldiering had made them
    selfish and deceitful. A writer of the time speaks, and evidently with much
    prejudice, against the De Meurons. "They were," he says, "a medley of almost all
    nations&mdash;Germans, French, Italians, Swiss and others. They were bad farmers and
    withal very bad subjects; quarrelsome, slothful, famous bottle companions and ready
    for any enterprise however lawless and tyrannical." A few years later we find it
    stated that they made free with the cattle of their neighbors, and the chronicler
    does not hesitate to say that the herds of the De Meurons grew in number in exactly
    the same ratio as those of the Scottish settlers decreased.</p>
    <p>Some four years after the settlement of the De Meurons a sunburst came upon them
    quite unexpectedly.</p>
    <p>Lord Selkirk in the very last years of his life planned to bring a band of
    Protestant settlers from Switzerland. A Colonel May, late of another of the mercenary
    regiments, accepted the duty of going to Switzerland, issuing a very attractive
    invitation to settlers, and succeeded in shipping a considerable number of Swiss
    families to his so-called Red River paradise.</p>
    <p>This band of Colonists, consisting as they did of "watch and clock-makers, pastry
    cooks and<span class ="pagenum">155</span><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a> musicians," were
    quite unfit for the rough work of the Selkirk Colony. In 1821 they were brought by
    way of Hudson Bay, over the same rocky way as the earlier Colonists came. They were
    utterly poverty stricken, though honest, and well-behaved. Their only possession of
    value was a plenty of handsome daughters. The Swiss families on arrival were placed
    under tents nearby Fort Douglas. As soon as possible many of the Swiss settlers were
    placed alongside the De Meurons on German Creek. Good Mr. West, who had just been
    sent out as chaplain by the Hudson's Bay Company, in place of the minister of their
    own faith promised to the Scottish settlers, did a great stroke of work in marrying
    the young Swiss girls to the De Meuron bachelors of German Creek. The description of
    the way in which the De Meurons invited families having young women in them to the
    wifeless cabins is ludicrous. A modern "Sabine raid" was made upon the young damsels,
    who were actually carried away to the De Meuron homesteads. The Swiss families which
    had the misfortune to have no daughters in them were left to languish in their
    comfortless tents. The afflictions of the earlier Selkirk settlers were increased by
    the arrival of these settlers. With the Selkirk settlers in their first decade the
    first consideration was always food. Till that question is settled no Colony
<span class ="pagenum">156</span><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a> can advance. Probably the most
    alarming and hopeless feature of their new colonial life was the appearance of vast
    flights of locusts or grasshoppers, which devoured every blade of wheat and grass in
    the country. To those who have never seen this plague it is inconceivable. Some
    thirty-five years ago in Manitoba the writer witnessed the utter devastation of the
    country by these pests. Some thirteen years before the coming of the first Colonists
    this plague prevailed. About the end of July, 1818, these riders of the air made
    their attack. In this year the Selkirk Colonists were greatly discouraged by the
    capture and removal to Canada, by the Nor'-Westers, of Mr. James Sutherland, their
    spiritual guide. But their labors now seem likely to be rewarded by a good harvest.
    The oats and barley were in ear, when suddenly the invasion came. The vast clouds of
    grasshoppers sailing northward from the great Utah desert in the United States,
    alighted late in the afternoon of one day and in the morning fields of grain, gardens
    with their promise, and every herb in the Settlement were gone, and a waste like a
    blasted hearth remained behind. The event was more than a loss of their crops, it
    seemed a heaven-struck blow upon their community, and it is said they lifted up their
    eyes to heaven, weeping and despairing. The sole return of<span class ="pagenum">157</span><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a> their labors for the season was a few ears of
    half-ripened barley which the women saved and carried home in their aprons. There was
    no help for it but to retire to Pembina, although there was less fear than formerly
    for as a writer of the day says: "The settlers had now become good hunters; they
    could kill the buffalo; walk on snowshoes; had trains of dogs trimmed with ribbons,
    bells and feathers, in true Indian style; and in other respects were making rapid
    steps in the arts of a savage life."</p>
    <p>The complete loss of their crops left the settlers even without the seed-wheat
    necessary to sow their fields. The nearest point of supply of this necessity was an
    agricultural settlement in the State of Minnesota, upwards of five hundred miles
    away. Here was a mighty task&mdash;to undertake to cross the plains in winter and to
    bring back in time for the seeding time in spring the wheat which was necessary. But
    the Highlander is not to be deterred by rocky crag or dashing river, or heavy snow in
    his own land and he was ready to face this and more in the new world. And so a daring
    party went off on snowshoes, and taking three months for their trip, reached the land
    of plenty and secured some hundred bushels at the price of ten shillings a
    bushel.</p>
    <p>The question now was how to transport the wheat through a trackless wilderness. Up
    the<span class ="pagenum">158</span><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a> Mississippi River for
    hundreds of miles the flat boats constructed for the purpose were painfully
    propelled, and passing through the branch known as the Minnesota River the Stony Lake
    was reached. This lake is the source of the Minnesota and Red rivers, and being at
    high water in the spring it was possible to go through the narrow lake from one river
    to the other with the rough boats constructed. The Red River was reached by the
    fearless adventurers who brought the "corn out of Egypt." They did not, however,
    reach the Red River with their treasure till about the end of June, 1820, and while
    the wheat grew well it was sown too late to ripen well, although it gave the settlers
    grain enough to sow the fields of the coming year. This expedition cost Lord Selkirk
    upwards of a thousand pounds sterling. In the following year the grasshoppers again
    visited the Red River fields, but by a sudden movement which, by some of the good
    Colonists was interpreted to be a direct interference of Providence on their behalf,
    the swarms of intruders passed away never to appear again in the Red River for half a
    century.</p>
    <p>The presence of the grasshoppers upon the Canadian prairies is one of interest. It
    is known that they appeared throughout the territory of Red River a dozen years or so
    before the coming of the Selkirk Colonists, also during<span class ="pagenum">159</span><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a> the period we have been describing, and then not
    till the period from 1868 to 1875. During the latter half of this period the writer
    saw their devastations in Manitoba. The occurrence of the grasshopper at times in all
    agricultural districts in America is very different from the grasshopper or locust
    plague which we are describing. The red-legged Caloptenus or the Rocky Mountain
    locust are provided for lofty flight and pass in myriads over the prairies, lighting
    whenever a cloud obscures the sun. At one time the writer saw them in such hordes
    that they were found from Winnipeg to Edmonton, over a region about one thousand
    miles in breadth. In that year they devoured not only crops and garden products but
    almost completely ate up the grass on the prairie to such an extent as to make it
    useless for hay. In the year 1875 they appeared, in the main, for the last time in
    Manitoba, and in that year their disappearance was as sudden as in the former case of
    1821. Under the wing upon the body of each grasshopper was to be found one or more
    scarlet red parasites which drew all the juices from the body of the insect and
    produced death. For a third of a century they have been almost unknown, and the area
    of cultivated ground in the States of North and South Dakota, where they may supply
    their hunger renders it likely that Manitoba will know them no more. It
<span class ="pagenum">160</span><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a> cannot be wondered at that such
    continuous disasters made the settler whether Scottish, De Meuron, or Swiss,
    extremely discontented. During the period of the scourge, the only resource was to
    winter at Pembina in reasonable distance from the buffalo-herds. In one of these
    years a number of the Selkirk Colonists did not return to their farms but emigrated
    to the United States. As we shall see in a few years after the grasshopper scourge
    the flood of the Red River took place, when the De Meurons and Swiss, with one or two
    exceptions, disappeared from the Colony and became citizens of the United States.

    <p>That such violence and bloodshed as that about Fort Douglas, should be seen by
    British subjects under the flag which stands for justice and equal rights made
    sober-minded Britons blush. While Lord Selkirk's agents on the banks of the Red River
    may have been aggressive in pushing their rights, yet to the Canadians was chargeable
    the greater part of the bloodshed. This was but natural. To the hunter, the trapper,
    and the frontiersman the use of firearms is familiar. The fur trader protects himself
    thus from the bear and the panther. The hot blood of the Metis as he careered over
    the prairie on his steed boiled up at the least provocation.</p>
    <p>But the disheartening law suits through which Lord Selkirk passed in Sandwich,
    Toronto, and Montreal, reflected more dishonor on the Canadians than did even the
    bloody violence of the Bois-Brul&eacute;s. The chicanery employed by the Canadian
    courts, the procuring<span class ="pagenum">162</span><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a> of
    special legislation to adapt the law to Lord Selkirk's case, and the invocation of
    the highest social and even clerical influence in Upper Canada for the purpose of
    injuring his Lordship will ever remain a blot on earlier Canadian jurisprudence.
    Fortunately the rights of man, whether native or foreigner, are now better understood
    and more fully protected in Canada than they were in the second decade of the
    nineteenth century. Col. Coltman's report, as already stated, was a model of
    truthfulness, fair play and freedom from prejudice, and Coltman was a Canadian
    appointee.</p>
    <p>So grave, however, were the rumours of these events happening on the plains of
    Rupert's Land, as they reached Britain that the House of Commons named a committee to
    enquire into the troubles. This committee sat in 1819, and the result is a blue-book
    of considerable size which exposes the injustice most fully. The violence and
    bloodshed which the fur traders now heard of far and near paralyzed the fur trade
    carried on by both fur companies, and brought the financial affairs of both companies
    to the verge of destruction. Two startling events of the next year produced a great
    shock. These were sudden and untimely deaths of the two great opponents&mdash;Lord
    Selkirk at an early age in France, and Sir Alexander Mackenzie, at his estate in
    Scotland, he having been seized<span class ="pagenum">163</span><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">
  </a> with sudden illness on his way from London. The two men died within
    a month of one another in the spring of 1820. Their passing away was surely
    impressive. It seemed like an offering to the god of peace in order that the vast
    region with its scattered and thunderstruck inhabitants from Lake Superior to the
    Pacific Ocean might be saved from the horrors of a cruel war of brother against
    brother, and a war which might involve even the cautious but hot-blooded Indian
    tribes.</p>
    <p>Though the two parties were made up of daring and head-strong men, yet adversity
    is a hard but effective teacher.</p>
    <p>The Hudson's Bay Company was represented by Andrew Colville, a warm friend of the
    house of Selkirk, the opponents by Edward Ellice, a Nor'-Wester. It seemed, indeed,
    the very irony of fate that Ellice should be a negotiator for peace. He and his sons
    the writer heard spoken of by the late Earl of Selkirk&mdash;the son of the
    founder&mdash;as the bear and cubs. On the other hand the burly directors of the
    Hudson's Bay Company possessed with all the confidence of the British Lion, and with
    their motto of "Skin for skin" were only brought to a state of peace by the loss of
    dividends. Much correspondence passed between the offices of Leadenhall Street and
    Suffolk Lane in London, which the two companies occupied, but articles
<span class ="pagenum">164</span><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a> of agreement were not
    sufficient to make a union.</p>
    <p>All such coalitions to be successful must circle around a single man.</p>
    <p>This man was a young Scottish clerk, who had spent a year only in the far
    Athabasca district. He had not depended on birth or influence for his advancement,
    was not yet wholly immersed in the traditions or prejudices of either company, and
    had consequently nothing to unlearn. Montreal became the Canadian headquarters of the
    company, but now the annual meeting of the traders where he as Governor presided, was
    held at Norway House. The offices in London were united, and thus the affairs of the
    fur trade were provided for and outward peace at least was guaranteed. We are,
    however, chiefly dealing with the affairs of Assiniboia as Lord Selkirk called it, or
    with what was more commonly called Red River Settlement. This belonged to Lord
    Selkirk's heirs. The executors were, of course, Hudson's Bay Company grandees. They
    were Sir James Montgomery, Mr. Halkett, Andrew Colville, and his brother the
    Solicitor-general of Scotland. When the news came of the death of Lord Selkirk, the
    mishaps and disturbances of the Colony had been so many, that Hudson's Bay Company,
    Nor'-Westers, Settlers, and Freemen all said, "That will end the Colony
<span class ="pagenum">165</span><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a> now!" To the surprise of
    everyone the first message from the executors was one of courage, and the
    announcement was made that their first aim would be to send six hundred new settlers
    to the banks of Red River.</p>

    <p>The angry passions which had been roused<span class ="pagenum">166</span><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">
  </a> led the English directors to take the very wise step of sending out
    two representatives&mdash;one from each of the old companies to rearrange all matters
    and settle all disputes. The two delegates were Nicholas Garry, the Vice-Governor of
    the Hudson's Bay Company, and Simon McGillivray, who bore one of the most influential
    names of the Nor'-Wester traders. They were not, however, equally well liked. Garry
    was a courteous, fair, and kindly gentleman. He won golden opinions among officers
    and settlers alike. McGillivray was suspicious and selfish, so the records of the
    time state. They came to the Red River in 1821, and Garry entered particularly into
    the arrangement of the Forts at the Forks. The old Fort Douglas was retained as
    Colony Fort, and the small Hudson's Bay Company trading house as well as Fort
    Gibraltar were absorbed into the new fort which was erected on the banks of the
    Assiniboine between Main Street and the bank of the Red River. All the letters and
    documents of the time speak of Governor Garry's visits as carrying a gleam of
    sunshine wherever he went and it was appropriate that the new fort built in the
    following year should bear the name Fort Garry. This was the wooden fort, which still
    remained in existence though superseded as a fort in 1850.</p>
    <p>At the time of Governor Garry's visit the<span class ="pagenum">167</span><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">
  </a> population of the settlement may be considered to have been about
    five hundred. These were made up of somewhat less than two hundred Selkirk Colonists,
    about one hundred De Meurons, a considerable number of French Voyageurs and Freemen,
    Swiss Colonists perhaps eighty, and the remainder Orkney, employees of the Hudson's
    Bay Company. The Colony was, however, beginning to organize itself. The accounts of
    the French settlers are very vague, an occasional name flitting across the page of
    history. One family still found on Red River banks, gains celebrity as possessing the
    first white woman who came to Rupert's Land. With her husband she had gone to
    Edmonton in &mdash;&mdash;, and had wandered over the prairies. In 1811, with her
    husband, she first saw the Forks of Red River and wintered in 1811-12 at Pembina, the
    winter which the first band of Colonists spent at York Factory. Lajimoniere became a
    fast adherent of Lord Selkirk, and made a famous and most dangerous winter journey
    through the wilds alone, carrying letters from Red River to Montreal, delivered them
    personally to Lord Selkirk in 1815.</p>
    <p>The Lajimonieres received with great delight in 1818 the first Roman Catholic
    missionaries who reached Red River. These were sent through Lord Selkirk's influence,
    and the large gift of land known as the Seigniory lying east<span class ="pagenum">168</span><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a> of St. Boniface was the reward given to the early
    pioneer missionaries&mdash;Provencher and Dumoulin, men of great stature and manly
    bearing. In the year of their arrival James Sutherland, the Presbyterian chaplain of
    the Selkirk Colonists, was taken by the Nor'-Westers to Upper Canada, whither his
    son, Haman Sutherland, had gone in 1815 with Duncan Cameron. The Earl of Selkirk had
    promised to send to his Scottish Colonists a minister of their own faith. On his
    death in France his agent in London was Mr. John Pritchard. Seventeen days after the
    death of Lord Selkirk, Rev. John West was appointed to come as chaplain to the
    Colonists and the other Protestants of Red River. Pritchard arrived by Hudson's Bay
    ship at York Factory 15 Aug., 1820, having Mr. West in company with him.</p>
    <p>And now Colville wrote to Alexander Macdonell, the Governor of the Settlement:
    "Mr. West goes out and takes with him persons acquainted with making bricks and
    pottery." Macdonell was a Roman Catholic, but Colville wrote: "I trust also that by
    your example and advice you will encourage all the Protestants, Presbyterians as well
    as others to attend divine service as performed by Mr. West. He will also open
    schools." As to Mr. West's support a curiosity occurs in one of Mr. West's letters
    written in the following year from York<span class ="pagenum">169</span><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">
  </a> Factory. He speaks of an agreement between Lord Selkirk and the
    Selkirk Settlers.</p>
    <p>"That the Settlers will use their endeavours for the benefit and support of the
    clergyman and shall be chargeable therewith as follows (that is to say): each settler
    shall employ himself, his servants, his horses, cattle, carts, carriages and other
    things necessary to the purpose on every day and at every place to be appointed by
    the clergyman to whom, or whose flock he shall belong, not exceeding at and after the
    rate of three days in the spring and three days in the autumn of each year."</p>
    <p>This is a gem of ecclesiasticism.</p>
    <p>Mr. West says: "I find that it is impracticable to carry the same into effect.
    This is attributable to the distance of most of the settlers and the reluctance of
    the Scotch Settlers."</p>
    <p>Mr. West had made mention of this to Governor Garry.<span class ="pagenum">170</span><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a> </p>

    <h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
    <div class="subchap">SATRAP RULE.
    </div>
    <p>"Woe to the Nation," says a high authority, "whose King is a child," but far worse
    than even having a child-ruler is the fate of a Kingdom or Principality whose ruler
    is a hireling. The Roman Empire was ruled in the different provinces by selfish and
    dishonest adventurers, who tyrannized over the people, farmed out the revenues,
    bribed their favorites and defrauded their masters. Turkish Government or Persian
    Rule is to-day an organized system of extortion and oppression by unscrupulous
    Satraps. Lord Selkirk's two governors, Miles Macdonell and Robert Semple, had been
    removed, the former by capture, the latter by death. Alexander Macdonell in 1816
    became acting governor and was confirmed in office for five or six years afterward.
    In his regime the Grasshoppers came and did their destructive work, but the French
    people nicknamed him "Governor Sauterelle," Grasshopper Governor, for, says the
    historian of this decade he was so called, "because he proved as<span class ="pagenum">171</span><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a> great a destroyer within doors as the grasshoppers
    in the fields."</p>
    <p>Lord Selkirk had been a most generous and sympathetic founder to his Scottish
    Colony. He was not only proprietor of the whole Red River Valley, but he felt himself
    responsible for the support and comfort of his Colonists. He had to begin with
    supplying food, clothing, implements, arms and ammunition to his settlers. He had
    erected buildings for shelter and a store house and fort for the protection of them
    and their goods. He had supplied, in a Colony shop, provisions and all requisites to
    be purchased by his settlers and on account of their poverty to be charged to their
    individual accounts.</p>
    <p>George Simpson, who was the new Governor of the United Hudson's Bay Company, was
    for two years Macdonell's contemporary, and he in one of his letters says: "Macdonell
    is, I am concerned to say, extremely unpopular, despised and held in contempt by
    every person connected with the place, he is accused of partiality, dishonesty,
    untruth and drunkenness,&mdash;in short, by a disrespect of every moral and elevated
    feeling."</p>
    <p>Alexander Ross says of him, "The officials he kept about him resembled the court
    of an Eastern Nabob, with its warriors, serfs, and varlets, and the names they bore
    were hardly less pompous, for here were secretaries, assistant secre<span class ="pagenum">172</span><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>taries, accountants, orderlies,
    grooms, cooks and butlers."</p>
    <p>Satrap Macdonell held high revels in his time. "From the time the puncheons of rum
    reached the colony in the fall, till they were all drunk dry, nothing was to be seen
    or heard about Fort Douglas but balling, dancing, rioting and drunkenness in the
    barbarous sport of those disorderly times." Macdonell's method of reckoning accounts
    was unique. "In place of having recourse to the tedious process of pen and ink the
    heel of a bottle was filled with wheat and set on the cask. This contrivance was
    called the 'hour glass,' and for every flagon drawn off, a grain of wheat was taken
    out of the hour glass, and put aside till the bouse was over."</p>
    <p>As was to be expected this disgraceful state of things led to grave frauds in the
    dealings with the Colonists, and when Halkett, one of Lord Selkirk's executors,
    arrived on Red River to investigate the complaints, a thorough system of "false
    entries, erroneous statements and over-charges" was found, and the discontent of the
    settlers was removed, though they were all heavily in debt to the Estate.</p>
    <p>It had been the object of Lord Selkirk from the beginning of his enterprise to
    give employment to his needy Colonists. Various enterprises were begun with this end
    in view, but they were all mere bubbles which soon burst.<span class ="pagenum">173</span><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a> John Pritchard, whom Lord Selkirk had taken as his
    secretary to London, was largely instrumental in floating the ill-starred scheme
    known as the "Buffalo Wool Company." Just as on the shores of the Mediterranean,
    shawls were made from the long wool of the goats, so it was thought that shawls could
    be made of the hair or wool of the buffalo. A voluminous correspondence given in many
    letters of Pritchard's to Lady Selkirk and other ladies of high station and to an
    English firm of manufacturers exploiting this project is before us. Sample squares of
    the cloth made of buffalo wool were distributed and in certain circles the novelty
    from the Red River was the "talk of the town," in London.</p>
    <p>On the banks of Red River the scheme took like wild-fire. All Red River people
    were to make fortunes. There were to be high wages and work for everybody. Wages were
    increased, and men were receiving nearly four dollars a day. Money became plentiful
    and provisions became dear and also scarce. The employees, higher and lower, became
    intoxicated with their success, as they now also became really intoxicated and fell
    into reckless habits. The work was neglected, and the enterprize collapsed. This was
    the earliest boom on Red River banks. Failure was sure to follow so mad a scheme. The
    buffalo wool cloth which<span class ="pagenum">174</span><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a> it
    cost some twelve dollars and a half to manufacture, partly in Red River Settlement
    and partly in England, was sold for little more than one dollar a yard. The
    &pound;2,000 of capital was all swallowed up, &pound;4,500 of debt to the Hudson's
    Bay Company was never paid, the scheme became a laughing stock in England, and
    failure and misery followed its collapse in the Colony.</p>
    <p>At this time the French-Canadian settlement at Pembina was induced to remove to
    St. Boniface on the Red River, where they gathered around their new priest,
    Provencher, to whom they became much attached.</p>
    <p>The Selkirk Trustees, in every way, continued ungrudgingly to advance the
    interests of the Colony, but their plans, though often mere theories failed more from
    extravagance and want of good men to execute them than from any other cause.</p>
    <p>Believing that farming was the thing needing cultivation in a country with so rich
    a soil, the Colonizers began the Hayfield farm on the north bank of the Assiniboine
    River, near what is now the outskirts of the City of Winnipeg, a little above the
    present Agricultural College buildings. Beginning with an expensive salary for
    Manager Laidlaw, the promoters erected ample farm buildings, barns, yards and
    stables. Importations were made of well-bred cattle and horses. Several years of mis<span class ="pagenum">175</span><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>management and helplessness
    resulted from this trial of a model farm, and it was given up at a total loss to the
    proprietors of &pound;3,500. The Assiniboine Wool Company was next started, but
    failed before the first payment of stock took place, without damage to anyone, so
    that, as was remarked, there was "much cry and little wool." The Flax and Hemp
    Company was the next unfortunate enterprise. This failed on account of there being no
    market, so that farmers never reaped the successful crops which they had grown. An
    expedition was made to Missouri, under Messrs. Burke and Campbell, to introduce sheep
    into the settlement. As the fifteen hundred sheep purchased had to be driven 1,500
    miles to their destination on Red River, only two hundred and fifty of the whole
    flock survived. Failure after failure taking place did not prevent the formation of a
    Tallow Company, which resulted in the loss of &pound;600 to &pound;1,000, and a
    considerable sum was spent also in an abortive attempt to open up a road to Hudson's
    Bay, a scheme which Lord Selkirk's letters show, he had in view from the very
    beginning of the life of the Colony. The courage and generosity of the executors of
    Lord Selkirk shown to all these enterprises reflects the greatest credit upon them.
    True, the concession of so wide an area of fertile land was worth it, and the pledges
    made to<span class ="pagenum">176</span><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a> the Selkirk settlers
    demanded it, but as in hundreds of other enterprises undertaken by British
    capitalists on the American continent, the choice of men foreign to the country and
    its conditions, the lack of conscience and economy on the part of the agents sent
    out, the dissension and jealousy aroused by every such attempt, as well as the
    absence of the means of transport by land and sea through the methods supplied by
    science to-day, resulted in a series of dismal failures, which placed an undeserved
    stigma upon the character of the soil, climate, and resources of Assiniboia. It took
    more than fifty years of subsequent effort to remove this impression.</p>
    <p>These experiences took place under those governors who succeeded Alexander
    Macdonell&mdash;the Grasshopper Governor. The first of them was Captain Bulger, an
    unfortunate martinet, though a man of good conscience and high ideals. He had a most
    uncompromising manner. He quarreled with the Hudson's Bay Company officer at Fort
    Garry on the one hand, and with old Indian Chief Peguis on the other. A whole crop of
    suggestions made by the Captain on the improvement of the Colony remain in his "Red
    River Papers." Bulger's successor was Governor Pelly, a relative of the celebrated
    Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company. The new Governor lacked nerve and de<span class ="pagenum">177</span><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>cision, and was quite unfitted
    for his position. His method of dealing with an Indian murderer was long repeated on
    Red River as a subject for humor, when he instructed the interpreter to announce to
    the criminal: "that he had manifested a disposition subversive of all order, and if
    he should not be punished in this world, he would be sure to be punished in the
    next." The hopelessness of carrying on the affairs of the Colony apart from those of
    the general affairs of the Hudson's Bay Company, was now seen, and on the suggestion
    of Governor Simpson, the management was placed in the hands of governors immediately
    responsible to the company. This change led to the appointment as Governor of Donald
    McKenzie. This old trader had taken part in the formation of the Astor Fur Company,
    and was in charge of one of the famous parties, which in 1811 crossed the continent,
    as described by Washington Irving. Ross Cox says of this beleaguered party: "Their
    concave cheeks, protuberant bones, and tattered garments indicated the dreadful
    extent of their privations. The old trader thus case-hardened faced bravely for eight
    years the worries of the Colony.<span class ="pagenum">178</span><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">

    <div class="subchap">AND THE FLOOD CAME.
    </div>
    <p>With fire and flood some of the greatest catastrophies of the world have been
    closely connected. The tradition of the Noachian deluge has been found among almost
    all peoples. Horace speaks of the mild little Tiber becoming so unruly that the
    fishes swam among the tops of the trees upon its banks. Tidal waves devastated the
    shores of England and France on several occasions. It is most natural that prairie
    rivers should exceed their banks and spread over wide areas of the land. Old Trader
    Nolin, one of the first on the prairies, states that a worse flood than that seen by
    the Selkirk Settlers took place fifty years before, and there were two other floods
    between these two. Each year, according to the tale of the old settlers, the rivers
    of the prairies have been becoming wider by denudation, so that each flood tends to
    be less. Several conditions seem to be necessary for a flood upon these prairie
    rivers. These are a very heavy snowfall during the prairie winter, a late spring in
    which the river ice retains its<span class ="pagenum">179</span><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">
  </a> hold, and a sudden period in the springtime of very hot weather,
    these being modified as the years go on by the ever-widening river channel.</p>
    <p>The winter of 1825-6 was one of the most terrific ever known in the history of the
    Selkirk Settlement. Just before Christmas the first woe occurred. The snow drove the
    herds of buffaloes far out upon the prairies from the river encampments and the
    wooded shelter. The horses in bands were scattered and lost, dying as they floundered
    in the deep snows. Even the hunters were cut off from one another, the hunters'
    families were driven hither and thither, and in many cases separated on the wide
    snowy plains. Sheriff Ross, who was a visitor from the Settlement to Pembina in the
    dreary winter there, describes the scene of horror. "Families here and families there
    despairing of life, huddled themselves together for warmth, and in too many cases,
    their shelter proved their grave. At first, the heat of their bodies melted the snow;
    they became wet, and being without food or fuel, the cold soon penetrated, and in
    several instances froze the whole into a body of solid ice. Some again, were found in
    a state of wild delirium, frantic, mad; while others were picked up, one here, and
    one there, overcome in their fruitless attempts to reach Pembina&mdash;some half-way,
    some more,<span class ="pagenum">180</span><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a> some less; one woman
    was found with an infant on her back, within a quarter of a mile of Pembina. This
    poor creature must have travelled, at least, one hundred and twenty-five miles, in
    three days and nights, till she sunk at last in the too unequal struggle for life."
    Such scenes might be expected in the valleys of the Highlands of Scotland, or amid
    the heavy snows of New Brunswick or Quebec, but they were a surprise upon the open
    prairie. Some of the settlers had devoured their dogs, raw hides, leather and their
    very shoes. The loss of thirty-three lives cast a gloom over the whole
    settlement.</p>
    <p>Anxiety had been aroused throughout the whole Colony. The St. Lawrence often
    overflows its banks at Montreal, the Grand River at Brantford and the Fraser at its
    delta, but the rarity of the Red River overflows led the people, after their winter
    disaster, to hope that they would escape a flood.</p>
    <p>This was not to be.</p>
    <p>As the Red River flows northward, the first thaw of spring is usually south of the
    American International Boundary line at the head waters of the river which divides
    Minnesota and Dakota. In these States the floods are always, in consequence, greater
    than they are in Manitoba. In this year the ice held very firm up to the end of
    April. On the second of May,<span class ="pagenum">181</span><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">
  </a> the waters from above rose and lifted the ice which still held in a
    mass together some nine feet above the level of the day before. Indians and whites
    alike were alarmed. The water overflowed its banks, and still continued to rise at
    Fort Garry. The Governor and his family were driven to the upper story of their
    residence in the fort, with the water ten feet deep below that.</p>
    <p>The whole river bank for miles was a scene of confusion and terror. Every home was
    an alarming scene as the flood reached it. The first thought was to save life. Amid
    the crying of children, the lowing of cattle and the howling of dogs, parents sought
    out all their children to see them safely removed. Parents and grown men and women
    fled in fright from their houses, and in many cases without any other garments than
    their working clothes. The only hope was to seek out somewhat higher spots more and
    more removed from the river. And with them went their cattle and horses.</p>
    <p>To those in boats&mdash;the stronger and more venturesome men&mdash;the task now
    came of removing the wheat and oats, what little furniture they possessed and the
    necessary cooking utensils.</p>
    <p>Blessed, on such occasions, are those who possess little for they shall have no
    loss.</p>
    <p>As the waters rose, the lake became wider,<span class ="pagenum">182</span><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">
  </a> and the wind blew the waves to a dangerous height. The ice broke up
    and the current increasing dashed this against the buildings, which at length gave
    way and all went floating down across the points&mdash;ice, log houses with dogs and
    cats frantic on their roofs. One eyewitness says: "The most singular spectacle was a
    house in flames, drifting along in the night, its one half immersed in water and the
    remainder furiously burning."</p>
    <p>As the flood of waters widened into a great expanse it became plain that it would
    be some time,&mdash;if indeed less than several months,&mdash;before the waters would
    begin to abate, and in the absence of an Ararat on which to rest, the settlers
    occupied the rock-bared elevations, the highest Stony Mount, only eighty feet above
    the level, with the middle bluff, little Stony Mountain and Bird's Hill, east of the
    river. It is interesting to know that Silver Heights and the banks of the Sturgeon
    Creek near its mouth, were not submerged and at their various points the Colonists
    pitched their tents and sojourned.</p>
    <p>In seventeen days from the first rise, the water reached its height, and hope
    began immediately to return. On the 22nd of May the waters commenced to assuage, and
    twenty days afterward the Settlers were able with difficulty to reach their homes
    again.<span class ="pagenum">183</span><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a> </p>
    <p>But every disaster has its side of advantage. During the escape of the Settlers to
    the heights, the De Meurons, losing all sense of restraint, stole the cattle of the
    Settlers and actually sold them meat from their own slaughtered cattle. So intense
    was the feeling of the Scottish Settlers against the De Meurons that the Selkirk
    Colonists chose another situation and moved to it</p>
    <p>Now that the flood was over, the De Meurons and Swiss became more restless than
    ever. They decided to move to the United States. The Selkirk Colonists were glad to
    see them go, and furnished them, free of cost, sufficient supplies for their journey.
    They departed on the 24th of June, their band numbering 243, and the sturdy pioneers
    who held to their land shed no tears of sorrow at their going.</p>
    <p>With remarkable courage and hope the Settlers returned after what was to some of
    them, their fourth Hegira, and immediately planted potatoes and small quantities of
    wheat and barley. This grew well and supplied food for them, and in the next two or
    three years no less than two hundred and four houses were built. The Settlement, now
    freed from dissension, had not gone through its fiery ordeal in vain. The news of a
    home for themselves and their dusky wives and half-breed children, had spread over
    the whole of Rupert's Land, and<span class ="pagenum">184</span><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">
  </a> now began, what Lieutenant-Governor Archibald, the first Governor
    of Manitoba, afterward spoke of as the floating down the rivers with their wives and
    children of the Hudson's Bay Company officers and men to the paradise of Red River.
    The great majority of the employees of the Company were Orkneymen. They gradually
    took up the most of the Red River lots surveyed, lying below Kildonan, and forming
    the Parishes of St. Paul's and St. Andrew's on Red River, down to St. Peter's Indian
    Reserve and St. James' and Headingly up the Assiniboine. The French half-breeds who
    removed from Pembina and different parts of Rupert's Land, made the great French
    parishes of St. Boniface, St. Norbert, St. Vital on the Red River, with St. Charles,
    St. Francois Xavier and Baie St. Paul on the Assiniboine. And now of Scottish
    Settlers with French and English half-breeds, the population of Red River Settlement
    had reached the number of 1,500 souls.<span class ="pagenum">185</span><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">

    <div class="subchap">THE JOLLY GOVERNOR.
    </div>
    <p>Great crises in the world's history generally produce the men who solve them.
    Cromwell, Washington, Garibaldi&mdash;each of them was the movement itself. A wider
    philosophy may see that the age or the Community evolves the man, but as Carlyle
    shows, it is the man who reacts upon the community, becomes the embodiment of its
    ideal, and is the mouthpiece and the right hand of the age which produces him.</p>
    <p>That Andrew Colville, a brother-in-law of Lord Selkirk, should select a young
    clerk in London and send him out to Athabasca to see the great fur-region of the
    Mackenzie River District, is not a wonderful thing, but that after one year of active
    service this young man should be chosen to guide the destinies of the great united
    fur company, made up of the Hudson's Bay and Nor'-Wester Companies is a wonder.</p>
    <p>This was the case with George Simpson, a Scottish youth, who was the illegitimate
    son of the maternal uncle of Thomas Simpson, the<span class ="pagenum">186</span><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">
  </a> famous Arctic explorer, who is known as having followed out a
    portion of the coast line of the Arctic Sea.</p>
    <p>Anyone can see that from the proverbial energy that is developed in those of
    inferior birth, there was here one of Nature's commanding spirits, who would bring
    order out of chaos.</p>
    <p>Moreover, the fact of his short service in a distant part of the fur country, left
    him free from prejudice, gave him an open mind, and permitted him to serve as a young
    man when he was yet plastic and adaptable&mdash;all this was in his favor.</p>
    <p>Governor Simpson was short of stature, but possessed of great energy and
    endurance. He was keen in mind and observing in his faculties. Active and determined,
    he might at times seem a martinet and a tyrant, but he had at the same time an easy
    and pleasant manner that enabled him to attract to himself his servants and
    subordinates, but especially the savages with whom he had constantly to have
    dealings. His ardent Highland nature led him to rejoice in the picturesque and the
    showy, and he was fond of music and of society. Given to change, Simpson became a
    great traveller and made a voyage around the world before the days of steam or
    railway.</p>
    <p>One of the first gatherings of the fur traders, in which the young Governor gained
    golden<span class ="pagenum">187</span><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a> opinions, was held at
    Norway House, the old resting place of the Selkirk Settlers. This meeting took place
    in June, 1823; the minutes of this meeting have been preserved and are interesting.
    Such items as, that Bow River Fort at the foot of the Rocky Mountains was abandoned;
    that because of prairie fires the buffaloes were far beyond Pembina; that the
    Assiniboine Indians had moved to the Saskatchewan for food; that trouble with the
    French traders had arisen on account of their determination to trade in furs; that
    the French half-breeds had largely moved from Pembina to St. Boniface; that the trade
    should be withdrawn from beyond the American Boundary line; that the Sioux Indians
    should be discouraged from coming to the Forts to trade; and that the company
    intended to take over the Colony from Lord Selkirk's trustees, all came up for
    consideration.</p>
    <p>These were all important and difficult problems, but the young Governor acted with
    such shrewdness and skill, that he completely carried the Council with him, and was
    given power to act for the Council during the intervals between its meetings&mdash;a
    thing most unusual.</p>
    <p>The Governor was ubiquitous.</p>

       <span class="caption">SIR GEORGE SIMPSON<br />
       Governor of Rupert's Land, 1821-60.</span>
    </div>
    <p>Now at Moose Factory, then at York; now at Norway House, but every year at Red
    River, the Governor saw for himself the needs of the<span class ="pagenum">188</span><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a> country, and the opportunities for advancing the
    interests of the Hudson's Bay Company.
    Forty times, that is, nearly every year of his Governorship, it is said he
    travelled the route between Montreal and Fort Garry, and this by canoe. He drove his
    men, who were chiefly French-Canadians, with irritating haste, and it is a story
    prevalent among the old Selkirk Settlers, that a stalwart French voyageur, who was a
    favorite of the Governor, was once, in<span class ="pagenum">189</span><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">
  </a> crossing the Lake of the Woods, so infuriated with his master's
    urging that he seized the tormentor who was small in stature, by the shoulders, and
    with a plentiful use of "sacr&eacute;s," dipped him into the lake, and then replaced
    him in the bottom of the canoe.</p>
    <p>It does not fall within the scope of our story to tell of Simpson's journeys
    through Rupert's Land, nor of his famous voyage around the world, but there is extant
    an account of his methods of appealing to the interest of the Indians and servants of
    the company in his notable progresses through the wilds. Some seven years after his
    appointment Governor Simpson made a voyage from Hudson Bay, across country to the
    Pacific Ocean, namely, from York Factory to Fort Vancouver on the Columbia River.
    Fourteen chief officers, factors and traders, and as many more clerks had gathered to
    see the chieftain depart. Taking with him a lieutenant&mdash;Macdonald, a doctor and
    two canoe crews, of nine men each, the jolly Governor with dashing speed ascended the
    Hayes River, up which the Selkirk Colonists had laboriously come, receiving as he
    left the Factory, loud cheers from all the people gathered, and a salute of seven
    guns from the garrison. The French-Canadian voyageurs struck up their boating songs
    with glee, and with dashing paddles left the bay behind.<span class ="pagenum">190</span><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a> </p>
    <p>The expedition was well provided with supplies, including wine for the gentlemen
    and spirits for the men.</p>
    <p>The arrival at Norway House was a f&eacute;te.</p>
    <p>Before reaching the Fort the party landed on the shore, and paying much attention
    to their toilets, put themselves in proper trim. In full career the canoes dashed
    through the deep rocky gorge leading to the Fort, the Governor's canoe, had on its
    high prow, conspicuous the French guide, who for the time gave commands. The Governor
    always took his Highland piper with him, and now there pealed forth from the canoe
    the strident strains of the bagpipes, while from the second canoe sounded the shrill
    call of the chief factor's bugle. As the party approached the Fort they saw the Union
    Jack with its magic letters H.B.C. floating from the tall flag-staff of Norway pine
    erected on Signal Hill. Bands of Indians from all directions were assembled to meet
    the great chief or "Kitche Okema," as they called him. Ceasing the pipes and bugle,
    the voyageurs sang with lively spirit one of their boat songs, to the great delight
    of their old friends, the Indians.</p>
    <p>The Governor was in 1839, at a time when Canada was much disturbed in both
    Provinces by the Mackenzie-Papineau rebellion, rewarded for the loyalty of his
    Company by having knighthood conferred upon him.<span class ="pagenum">191</span><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">
  </a> </p>
    <p>Sir George Simpson's annual visits to Red River Settlement were the bright spots
    in the life of the Colony. Never did a Governor get so near the people as did Sir
    George. Old settlers tell how when Sir George arrived every grievance, disaster,
    suspicion, or bit of gossip was faithfully carried to him, and his patience and
    ingenuity were freely exercised in "jollying" the people and giving them
    condescending attention.</p>
    <p>Sir George married in time, and on occasion brought Lady Simpson, who was a native
    of the country, to visit the Red River Settlement. Her presence was taken as a
    compliment by the people. Sir George Simpson, like many of the Hudson's Bay Company,
    had among all his business engagements the taste for literature. He encouraged the
    formation of libraries at the several trading posts, and in his letters throws in a
    remark about Sir Walter Scott, or Blackwood's last magazine, or other living topic,
    although the means of communication made literature often months late even on the
    banks of the Red River. His own effort in producing a book gave rise to a
    considerable amount of amusement. After his great journey around the world, he
    published an account of his travels in two considerable volumes. It is now no secret
    that these were prepared for him by a well-known judge of Red<span class ="pagenum">192</span><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a> River Settlement, of whom we speak more fully in a
    later chapter. This double authorship became decidedly inconvenient to Sir George on
    the celebrated occasion when he was cited in 1857 to give evidence before the
    Committee of the House of Commons as to Rupert's Land. Sir George's experience in
    introducing farming into Red River Settlement had been so troublesome, and expensive
    as well, that he really believed agriculture would be a failure in the West, and so
    he gave his evidence. Unfortunately for him his editor had indulged in his book, in a
    pictorial and fulsome description of the Rainy River, as an agricultural region. Mr.
    Roebuck quoted this passage and Sir George was in a serious dilemma. If he admitted
    it his evidence would seem untrue, if he denied it then he must deny his authorship.
    He admitted that the book was somewhat too flattering in its description.</p>
    <p>But, take him all in all, Sir George really stood for his duty and his people. He
    lifted the fur trade out of a slough of despond, he was kind and charitable to the
    people of the Red River Settlement, he was a good administrator and a patriot Briton,
    and though as his book tells and local tradition confirms it, he could not escape
    from what is called "the witchery of a pretty face," yet he rose to the position on
    the whole as a man who sought for the higher<span class ="pagenum">193</span><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">
  </a> interests of the vast territory under his sway, as well as for the
    financial advancement of his company.<br /><span class ="pagenum">194</span><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">

    <div class="subchap">THE OLIGARCHY.
    </div>
    <p>The struggle has always been between the masses and the classes. Privilege always
    strives to confine itself to a few. It could not be but that the echoes of the great
    British Reform Bill of 1832 should reach even the remote banks of Red River. The
    struggle for constitutional freedom was also going on in Upper Canada, as well as in
    Lower Canada where the French-Canadians were fighting bitterly for their rights.
    Besides all this in the Red River Settlement the existence of a Company store&mdash;a
    monopoly&mdash;could never prove satisfactory to a community of British blood. Had
    the Colony shop been ever so justly and honestly conducted it could not be popular,
    how much less so must it have been in the hands of Alexander Macdonell, the peculator
    and deceiver.</p>
    <p>It is true the Company store, of which we speak, was not that of the Hudson's Bay
    Company proper, but rather the possession of Lord Selkirk's heirs.<span class ="pagenum">195</span><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a> </p>
    <p>Gradually the rulership was coming under the direction of Governor Simpson, though
    there was the local Governor who was nominally independent.</p>
    <p>Even when Governor Simpson was invoked, it is to be remembered that he and his
    company were the embodiment of privilege. But the Governor was a surprisingly shrewd
    man. He saw the aspiration after freedom, of both Scottish and French Settlers. True,
    gaunt poverty did not stalk along the banks of Red River as it had done in the first
    ten years of the Colony, but just because the people were becoming better housed,
    better clad, and better fed, were they becoming more independent. The unwillingness
    to be controlled was showing itself very distinctly among the French half-breeds as
    they grew in numbers and dashed over the prairies on their fiery steeds. They were
    hunters, accustomed to the use of firearms and were, therefore, difficult to
    restrain.</p>
    <p>The Governor's policy clearly defined in his own mind became, for the next ten
    years, the policy of the Company. We have seen that the Governor built Lower Fort
    Garry, and he regarded this as his residence, nearly twenty miles down the river from
    the Forks, which was the centre of French influence. Even before doing this in 1831
    he had, in the year preceding this, as Ross tells us, built a small powder
<span class ="pagenum">196</span><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a> magazine at Upper Fort Garry,
    and it goes without saying that rulers do not build powder magazines for the purpose
    of ornament.</p>
    <p>In 1834, as we learn from Hon. Donald Gunn, who was then a resident of Red River
    Settlement, and who has left us his views in the manuscript afterward published
    coming up to 1835, a most serious revolt took place among the Metis. Gunn's account
    is vivid and interesting.</p>

    <p>The French half-breeds were entirely dependent upon hunting, trapping or voyaging.
    One hundred or one hundred and fifty men were required to transfer goods, furs, etc.,
    from the boats during the time of open water. Generally they received advances from
    the Fur Company at the beginning of summer, for they were always in debt to the
    company. On the close of the open season they were paid the balance due them. After a
    few days of idleness and gossip the money would be spent and want would begin to
    press them. A new engagement with an advance would follow. The agreement was signed,
    and so like an endless chain, the natives were always held to the Company's interest.
    At Christmas, these workmen received a portion of their advance, and as is well
    known, the company relaxed somewhat its rules as to liquor selling at this season. At
    this Christmas time of 1834 payments were being made and indul<span class ="pagenum">197</span><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>gence was
    supreme, when a French half-breed named Larocque entered the office of the
    accountant, Thomas Simpson, a relative of Sir George, and demanded his pay in a
    disrespectful way. Simpson replied somewhat roughly, which led Larocque to insult the
    officer of the company. Simpson seized the fire poker and striking Larocque's head
    made an ugly wound on his scalp.</p>
    <p>Larocque's companions retired without violence, but on returning home, gathered
    the violent spirits together, came back to Fort Garry and demanded that Thomas
    Simpson should be given up to them for punishment, with the threat that if this were
    not granted, they would destroy the Fort, and take Simpson by violence. This being
    refused them, the Metis returned to their homes to prepare themselves for action, and
    began the war songs and war dances of their savage ancestors in true Indian style.
    Governor Christie, the local authority, took with him Chief Factor Cameron, Robert
    Logan and Alexander Ross, chief men of the Settlement, and visited the gathering of
    the Metis. One of the deputation writes that "they resembled a troop of furies more
    than human beings." For some time the mob refused the approaches of the officers of
    the Company. At length the quarrel was settled by the Company agreeing to pay the
    voyageur's wages in full, and that<span class ="pagenum">198</span><a name="Page_198"
    id="Page_198"></a> he should be allowed to remain at home. Probably, however, the most
    acceptable part of the concession, was the gift by the Company of a "ten-gallon keg
    of rum and tobacco."</p>
    <p>Next spring another demonstration was made by the Metis for other demands, but
    these were refused.</p>

    <p>Then, from every direction came the imperious suggestion that some more effective
    form of government should be adopted. This was granted. True, Governor Simpson did
    not succeed in satisfying all the Settlers, though in this respect he found it easier
    to supply the volatile French-Canadian hunters, than the hard-headed people of
    British origin. The method of Governor Simpson, along with the London
<span class ="pagenum">199</span><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a> Board of the Hudson's Bay
    Company choosing the Council of Assiniboia, certainly did smack of the age of Henry

    <p>The Council consisted of fifteen members, viz.: the Governor-in-Chief Simpson, the
    Local Governor Christie, the Roman Catholic Bishop, two Church of England clergymen,
    three retired Hudson's Bay Company officers, the leading doctor of the Colony,
    Sheriff Ross, Coroner McCallum, and three leading business men, viz.: Pritchard,
    Logan and McDermott. It is noticeable that though the French element numbered about
    one-half of the people, that only one Councillor besides the Bishop was given them,
    and this was Cuthbert Grant, now settled down from the period of his
    Bois-brul&eacute;s impulsiveness to be the Warden of the Plains, with an influence
    over the Metis, that can only be described as magical.</p>
    <p>Judged by the methods of representative government the Council was rather a
    burlesque.</p>
    <p>Sheriff Alexander Ross, though a member of the Council, says: "To guard against
    foolish and oppressive acts, the sooner the people have a share in their own affairs
    the better. It is only fair that those that have to obey the laws should have a voice
    in making them."</p>
    <p>Hon. Donald Gunn, who was not on the Council, says: "The majority of the Council
    thus<span class ="pagenum">200</span><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a> appointed were, no doubt,
    the wealthiest men in the Colony and generally well-informed, and yet their
    appointment was far from being acceptable to the people who knew that they were
    either sinecurists or salaried servants of the Hudson's Bay Company, and consequently
    were not the fittest men to legislate for people who retained some faint recollection
    of the manner in which the popular branch of the legislature in their native land was
    appointed, and who never ceased to inveigh against the arbitrary manner in which the
    Governor-in-chief chose the legislators."</p>
    <p>Notwithstanding the writer's perfect sympathy with both of these opinions, it is
    but fair to state that the Council of Assiniboia did in ordinary times do many things
    which were most beneficial and helpful to the Red River Community.</p>
    <p>Its most distressing failures were in those things which are very essential. (1)
    Being a compromise body it had no power of progressive development, and in the whole
    generation of its existence it did practically nothing to advance the public,
    intellectual, or moral interests of the people. (2) Perhaps its most serious
    breakdown took place, as we shall see, in the failure of its judicial system.
    Executive power it had none, as seen in the cases where jail-delivery took place
    again and again by the friends of<span class ="pagenum">201</span><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a> the prisoners boldly
    extricating whom they would. (3) But most alarming and miserable was its failure to
    act in its moribund days, when it allowed, as we shall see, a mob to seize Fort Garry
    and bring in an era of disorder which made every self-respecting British subject
    blush with shame.</p>

    <div class="subchap">THE OGRE OF JUSTICE.
    </div>
    <p>The wild life of the prairie or mountain cultivates a spirit of freedom. When
    individuals must become a law unto themselves, when the absence of steamers,
    railways, electric power, work-shops, and mills, throws men on their own resources,
    they find it irksome to obey the law. They regard its restrictions as tyrannical. The
    prairie horse becomes free. He must be caught with the lasso, he needs to be hobbled
    near the camp, it is necessary to curb him in his temper, but in his wild state he
    can provide for himself. He knows the best pasture and seeks it, he is acquainted
    with the water courses and finds them, he returns or not to his stable or covert at
    his own sweet will, he fights the wolf or the bear and protects the colts from the
    wild beasts.</p>
    <p>As is the prairie steed, so to a large extent is his master. He is apt to despise
    civilization, prefers his buckskin coat and fringed leggings, and loves the moccasin
    rather than the stiff leather shoe.<span class ="pagenum">203</span><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">
  </a> </p>
    <p>With him the idea of sub-division of property is not developed. There are no local
    game laws. He shoots large or small game, moose or prairie chicken, whenever he can
    find them. He traps on whatever stream he chooses. His idea of personal property is
    very liberal. He is large-hearted and bountiful, divides his find of game with his
    neighbors, and his shanty has, as he says, "a latch hanging outside the door," for
    any wanderer or passing stranger.</p>
    <p>This many-sided notion of freedom belongs to all primitive peoples and societies.
    Of the Red River Community the French half-breed was of the most unsubdued and
    restive type, for he followed the ways of the Indians, while the Selkirk Colonists
    and their descendants always professed to be farmers, and hunting was only their
    diversion. Moreover, being of Scottish blood, they had been taught to fear God and
    honor the King.</p>
    <p>We have seen that Governor Simpson had a plan in his mind for gaining control and
    preserving order in his own kingdom. His idea of building fortified stone forts is
    chiefly seen in the cases of Upper and Lower Forts Garry. Fort Garry was, as we have
    seen, well on the way to completion by the time of the French outbreak in connection
    with Larocque. And Governor Christie was authorized to go on and construct a still
    more elaborate fort at the<span class ="pagenum">204</span><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>
    Forks to replace the wooden Fort Garry built shortly after the union of the
    Companies. Thus, a large Fort with numerous buildings, suitable for trade and
    residence, was begun in 1835, and around it a substantial stone wall was built. The
    dimensions from east to west were 280 feet, and from north to south 240 feet. The
    fort faced the Assiniboine River, and each of its corners showed a large and
    well-built bastion. The bastions were provided with port holes, and all about the
    structure suggested the possibility of an armed struggle. This was begun in the same
    year as the formation of the Council of Assiniboia, and was fairly advanced to
    completion by 1839. Laws for the government of the people, and the administration of
    justice were passed by the Council, in accordance with the opening address of
    Governor Simpson, when he said: "The time is at length arrived, when it becomes
    necessary to put the administration of justice on a more firm and regular footing
    than heretofore."</p>
    <p>And now, in 1839, in this Arcadia of Red River there became evident the dreadful
    presence of the law in the person of Adam Thom, first Recorder of Rupert's Land, who,
    as compared with the humble incomes of the people of Red River, had the enormous
    salary of &pound;700 a year bestowed upon him by the Hudson's Bay Company. The plan
    was a very real one in<span class ="pagenum">205</span><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>
Governor Simpson's mind when he took a step so
    decided.</p>

       <span class="caption">ADAM THOM, LL.D.<br />
       Recorder and Author.<br />
       Lived in Red River Settlement 1839-1854.</span>
    </div>
    <p>And the man who had been chosen for this post was no man of putty. He was a
    Scotchman of commanding presence, decided opinions and strong will. He was a man of
    rather aggressive and combative disposition. The writer met him in London long after
    he had retired&mdash;and this was some thirty years ago, and though the judge was
    then upwards of three score and ten, he was yet a man of force and decision. A
    graduate of Aberdeen University, Adam Thom had come to Montreal as a lawyer, and was
    for a time on Lord Durham's staff. He had taken high ground against Papineau's
    rebellion, and was known as one of the strongest newspaper controversialists of the
    time. He was a determined opponent of the French-Canadian rebellion, as he was of
    rebellion in any form whatever. Evidently, Governor Simpson chose a man "after his
    own heart" for the difficult task, of introducing law and order among the turbulent
    Nor'-Westers.</p>
    <p>The arrival of the new Judge in the Red River Settlement gave rise to much
    comment. The spirit of discontent had strengthened, as we have seen among the
    Colonists and English-speaking half-breeds. The Hudson's Bay Company had now
    re-bought the land of Assiniboia from Lord Selkirk's heirs. Hitherto
<span class ="pagenum">206</span><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a> it was difficult to find out
    precisely who their oppressor was. Now, though Governor Simpson sought by diplomacy
    to evade the responsibility, yet the explanation given by the Colonists of the
    arrival of Recorder Thom, was that he had come to uphold the Company's pretensions
    and to restrict their liberties. According to Ross,the Colonists reasoned that "a man
    placed in Recorder Thom's position, liable to be turned out of office at the
    Company's pleasure, naturally provokes the doubt whether he could at all times be
    proof against the sin of partiality. Is it likely," they said, "that he could always
    take the impartial view of a case that might involve in its results his own interests
    or deprive him of his daily bread?"</p>
    <p>Likewise, on the part of the French half-breeds, there was the same distrust in
    regard to the limiting of the privileges which they enjoyed, while along with this it
    had been noised about that during the Papineau trouble in Canada, the Judge was no
    favorite of the French. The French half-breeds, accordingly, became strongly
    prejudiced against the new Recorder.</p>
    <p>In the year after the arrival of Recorder Thom, a most startling and mysterious
    event&mdash;which indeed has never been solved to the present day, happened in the
    case of Thomas Simpson, who it will be remembered had roused by his crushing blow on
    the head of Larocque, the<span class ="pagenum">207</span><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a> rage
    of the whole French half-breed community. The case was that Thomas Simpson, with a
    party of natives, had been going southward through Minnesota, ahead of the main body
    of sojourners. In a state of frenzy he had shot two of his four companions. The other
    two returned to the main body, and got assistance. He was seen to be alive as they
    approached him, a shot was heard, and then shots were fired in his direction by those
    observing him. Whether he committed suicide or was killed by those approaching, some
    of whom were French, will never be known. The fact that he had quarreled with the
    French half-breeds, five years before this event, was used to throw suspicion. The
    body of Simpson was carried back to St. John's Cemetery in Winnipeg, and it is said
    was buried along the wall in token of the belief that he had committed suicide.</p>
    <p>What the body of the people had feared in the tightening of the legal restrictions
    by the new laws and new officials, did actually take place. The French half-breeds
    were, as we have seen, chiefly given to hunting. In theory, the Hudson's Bay Company
    possessed <i>all hunting rights under their charter</i>. A French-Canadian, Larant,
    and another half-breed also, had the furs, which they had hunted for, forcibly taken
    from them by legal authority, while in a third case an offender against the game laws
    had been actually<span class ="pagenum">208</span><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a> deported to
    York Factory. Alarm was now general among the French half-breeds. Hitherto the
    English half-breeds had been loyal to the Company. Alexander Ross gives an incident
    worth repeating as to how even the English half-breeds became rebellious. He says:
    "One of the Company's officers, residing at a distance, had placed two of his
    daughters at the boarding-school in the Settlement. An English half-breed, a comely
    well-behaved young man, of respectable connections, was paying his addresses to one
    of these young ladies, and had asked her in marriage. The young lady had another
    suitor in the person of a Scotch lad, but her affections were in favor of the former,
    while her guardian, the chief officer in Red River, preferred the latter. In his zeal
    to succeed in the choice he had made for the young lady, this gentleman sent for the
    half-breed and reprimanded him for aspiring to the hand of a lady, accustomed, as he
    expressed it, to the first society. The young man, without saying a word, put on his
    hat and walked out of the room; but being the leading man among his countrymen, the
    whole community took fire at the insult. 'This is the way,' said they, 'that we
    half-breeds are despised and treated.' From that time they clubbed together in high
    dudgeon and joined the French Malcontents against their rulers. The French
    half-breeds made a flag for use on<span class ="pagenum">209</span><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">
  </a> the plains called 'The Papineau Standard.' It is plain that rightly
    or wrongly, Recorder Thom has a thorny path to tread."<span class ="pagenum">210</span><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a> </p>

    <div class="subchap">A HALF-BREED PATRIOT.
    </div>
    <p>Canada looks with patriotic delight not only on her sons who remain at home to
    work out the problems of her developing life, but follows with keenest interest those
    Canadians who have gone abroad and made a name for themselves, and their country in
    other parts of the Empire or the world. Some of these are Judge Haliburton, Satirist;
    Roberts and Bliss Carman, Poets; Gilbert Parker, Grant Allen and Barr, Novelists;
    Romanes and Newcombe, Scientists; Girouard, Kennedy and Scott in the Army, and many
    others who have won laurels in the several walks of life. But Manitoba, or rather Red
    River Settlement has also its sons who have gone abroad to do distinguished service
    and bring honor to their place of birth. One of them was Alexander K. Isbister, most
    commonly known as the donor of upwards of $80,000, given as a Scholarship Fund to the
    University of Manitoba, but really more celebrated still, for the service he rendered
    his native land. A little less than thirty years ago the writer met Mr.
<span class ="pagenum">211</span><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a> Isbister in London and enjoyed
    his hospitality. Isbister was a tall and handsome man, showing distinctly by his
    color and high cheekbones that he had Indian blood in his veins. Receiving his early
    education in St. John's School, he had gone home to England, taken his degrees,
    become a lawyer, and afterward had gone into educational work. He was, at the time of
    the visit spoken of, Dean of the College of Preceptors in London, and had much
    reputation as an educationalist. But the service he rendered to his native land
    out-topped all his other achievements. We have already shown the tendency toward
    restriction being developed under Recorder Thom's leadership, in Red River
    Settlement. James Sinclair, a member of a most respectable Scotch half-breed family,
    had obtained the privilege from the Company to export tallow, the product of the
    buffalo, by way of York Factory to England. The venture succeeded, but a second
    shipment was held at York Factory for nearly two years, and thus Sinclair was
    virtually compelled to sell it to the Company.</p>
    <p>Twenty leading half-breeds then appealed to the Hudson's Bay Company to be allowed
    to export tallow at a reasonable rate. In 1844 two proclamations were issued, that
    before the Company would carry goods for any settler, a declaration from such
    settler, and the examination<span class ="pagenum">212</span><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a> of
    his correspondence in regard to his dealing in furs would first be necessary. The
    native people determined to oppose them. They claimed as having Indian blood, that
    they were entitled to aboriginal rights. Twenty leading English-speaking half-breeds,
    among them such respectable names as Sinclair, Dease, Vincent, Bird and Garrioch,
    demanded from Governor Christie a definite answer as to their position and rights.
    The Governor answered with sweet words, but the policy of "thorough" was steadily
    pushed forward, and a new land deed was devised by which the land would be forfeited
    should the settlers interfere in the fur trade. Next, heavy freights were put on
    goods going to England by way of Hudson Bay, and Sinclair, as an agitator, was
    refused the privilege of having his freight carried at any price. The spirits of the
    English-speaking half-breeds were raised to a pitch of discontent, quite equal to
    that of the French half-breeds, although the latter were more noisy and
    demonstrative. James Sinclair became the "village Hampden" who stood for his rights
    and those of his compeers.</p>
    <p>It was at this juncture that the valuable aid of Isbister came to his countrymen.
    In 1847 Isbister, with his educated mind, social standing, and valiant spirit led the
    way for his people, and with five other half-breeds of Red<span class ="pagenum">213</span><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a> River forwarded a long and able memorial to Earl
    Grey, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, bringing the serious charges against
    the Company, of neglecting the native people, oppressing all the settlers, and taking
    from them their natural rights. A perusal of this document leads us to the opinion
    that the charges were exaggerated, but nevertheless they showed how impossible it
    was, for a Trading Company, to be at the same time the Government of a country and to
    be equitable and high-minded. The Hudson's Bay Company answered this document sent
    them by the Imperial Government, and so far relieved themselves of some of the
    charges. But the storm raised could not be quieted. Isbister obtained new evidence
    and attacked the validity of the Company's Charter. Lord Elgin, the fair-minded
    Governor of Canada, claimed that he, in Canada, was too far away from the scene of
    dispute to give an authoritative answer, but on the whole he favored the Company.
    Lord Elgin, however, based his reply too much upon the statement of Colonel Crofton,
    a military officer, who had been sent to Red River. Alexander Ross said of Crofton,
    on the other hand, that he was a man "who never studied the art of governing a
    people."</p>
    <p>But the agitation still gained head.</p>
    <p>The mercurial French half-breeds now joined<span class ="pagenum">214</span><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">
  </a> in the struggle. They forwarded a petition to Her Majesty the
    Queen, couched in excellent terms, in the French language, in the main asking that
    their right to enjoy the liberty of commerce be given them. This petition was signed
    by nine hundred and seventy-seven persons, and virtually represented the whole French
    half-breed adult population.</p>
    <p>An important episode soon took place among the French, usually known as the "Sayer
    Affair." Of this we shall speak in another chapter. The movement, headed by Isbister,
    still continued, and led to the serious consideration by the British Government of
    the whole situation in Red River Settlement. The impatience of the people of all
    classes in Red River led to a new plan of attack. Not being able to influence
    sufficiently the British authorities, they forwarded a petition, signed by five
    hundred and seventy English-speaking people of Red River Settlement, to the
    Legislative Assembly of Canada. The grievances of the people were given in detail.
    The reason suggested for the deaf ear which had been given them by the British
    Parliament were stated to be "the chicanery of the Hudson's Bay Company, and its
    false representations."</p>
    <p>Isbister, in all his efforts, gained the unfailing respect and gratitude, not only
    of his own race, but very generally of the people of the<span class ="pagenum">215</span><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a> Red River Settlement. Ten years after the petition
    of Isbister and his friends had been presented to Earl Grey, a committee of the House
    of Commons was sitting to investigate the affairs of the Hudson's Bay Company. It was
    a sifting inquiry, in which Gladstone, Roebuck and other friends of liberty, took
    part. It, however, took a quarter of a century to bring about the union of Rupert's
    Land with Canada, although, as we shall see, in less than five years, a measure of
    amelioration came to the oppressed and indignant settlers of Red River. For this the
    people of Red River Settlement were largely indebted to the self-denying and
    persistent efforts of Alexander Isbister. The old settlers of Kildonan, the French
    and English half-breeds of the several parishes, and their descendants as well as the
    University of Manitoba and all friends of education ought to keep his memory green
    for what he did for them, for as a writer of his own time says, "He gained for
    himself a name that will live in days yet to come."<span class ="pagenum">216</span><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a> </p>

    <p>Stone forts and ermined judges were not, to the mind of the unbridled and
    ungovernable Metis. True, the French mind has a love for show and circumstance and
    dignity of demeanor, but the conviction had taken hold of the people of Red River,
    and especially of the French half-breeds, that these meant curtailment of their
    freedom. They felt the dice were loaded against them.</p>
    <p>But, now, in the year after Sinclair and his friends had shown such a firm front
    to Governor Christie, and when something like a feudal system was being introduced
    into the Red River Settlement, a new surprise came upon French and English alike.
    This was immediately after the terrible visitation of a plague, which had cut down
    one-sixteenth of the whole population. It was the arrival of a party of the Sixth
    Royal Regiment of Foot, along with artillery and engineers, amounting in all to five
    hundred souls. The breath of the people was taken away by this demonstration of
    force, and a chronicler<span class ="pagenum">217</span><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a> of the
    time says: "From the moment they arrived the high tone of lawless defiance and
    internal disaffection raised by our people against the laws and the authorities of
    the place were reduced to silence." Colonel Crofton, in command of the troops, was
    appointed Governor of the Settlement, and he proved a wise and honorable
    administrator. The regiment gained golden opinions from the people, and as they spent
    during their short stay of two years, a sum of &pound;15,000 in supplies, it was,
    indeed, a golden age for the hard-working Colonists. The leaving of the regiment was
    regretted by the Colony.</p>
    <p>Having now entered on a career of government by force, it would not do to let it
    drop. Hence the authorities enlisted in Britain a number of old pensioners, and under
    command of Major Caldwell, who was also to act as Governor of the Settlement, sent
    out, in each of two successive years, some seventy of these discharged soldiers to
    act as guardians of the peace. It was pretty well agreed that these men, to whom were
    given holdings of small pieces of land to the west of Fort Garry, now in the St.
    James District of Winnipeg, were simply imitators in conduct and disposition of the
    De Meurons, who had so vexed the Colonists. Major Caldwell, too, by his lack of
    business habits and his selfishness, alienated all the<span class ="pagenum">218</span><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a> leading men of the Colony, so that they refused to
    sit with him in Council. It was the common opinion that the turbulence and violence
    of the pensioners was so great that, as one of the Company said, "We have more
    trouble with the pensioners than with all the rest of the Settlement put together."
    The pensioners were certainly absolutely useless for the purpose for which they had
    been sent, that is to preserve order in the country. The Metis, at any rate, spoke of
    them with derision.</p>

    </div>
    <p>In the year following the removal of the troops the policy of preventing the
    French<span class ="pagenum">219</span><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a> half-breeds from buying
    and selling furs with the Indians was being carried out by Judge Thom, the relentless
    ogre of the law. Four men of the Metis had been arrested; of these the leader was
    William Sayer. He was the half-breed son of an old French bourgeois of the Northwest
    Company. He had been liberated on bail, and was to come up for trial in May. The
    charge against him was of buying goods with which to go on a trading expedition to
    Lake Manitoba.</p>
    <p>Possibly the case would be easily disposed of, and most likely dismissed with a
    trifling fine, although it was true that Sayer had made a stiff resistance on his
    being arrested. This violent resistance was but an example of the bitter and
    dangerous spirit that was developing among the Metis.</p>
    <p>A brave and restless man was now growing to have a dominating influence over the
    French half-breeds. This was Louis Riel, a fierce and noisy revolutionist, ready for
    any extremity. He was a French half-breed, was owner of a small flour mill on the
    Seine River, and he was the father of the rebel chief of later years. The day fixed
    for the Sayer trial by the legal authorities was a most unfortunate one. It was on
    May 17th, which on that year was Ascension Day, a day of obligation among the
    Catholic people of the Settlement. It was noticeable<span class ="pagenum">220</span><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a> that there was much ferment in the French parishes.
    Louis Riel, who was a violent, but effective speaker, of French, Irish and Indian
    descent, busied himself in stirring up resistance. The fact that it was a Church day
    for the Metis made it easy for them to gather together. This they did by hundreds in
    front of the St. Boniface Cathedral, where, piling up their guns, with which all the
    men were armed, at the Church door, they then entered and performed their sacred
    duties. At the close of the service, Riel, "the miller of the Seine," made a fiery
    oration, advocating the rescue of their compatriot Sayer, who was to be held for
    trial at the Court House. A French sympathizer said of this public meeting: "Louis
    Riel obtained a veritable triumph on that occasion, and long and loud the hurrahs
    were repeated by the echoes of the Red River."</p>
    <p>And now, under Riel's direction, by a concerted action, movement of the whole body
    was made to cross the Red River and march to the Court House, which stood beside the
    wall of Fort Garry. To allow the five hundred men to cross easily, Point Douglas was
    selected, and here by ferry boats, said to have been provided by James Sinclair, the
    English half-breed leader of whom we have spoken, the party crossed, and worked up to
    the highest pitch of excitement, stalked up the mile or two to the Court House.

    <p>Though somewhat anxious, the Governor and Court officials passed through the
    excited crowd which surrounded the Court House. It was expected that the Governor
    would order out a guard of pensioners to protect the Court, but he had dispensed with
    this, and so he, Recorder<span class ="pagenum">222</span><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a> Thom,
    and the Magistrate, took their seats upon the elevated platform of Justice precisely
    at eleven o'clock. Sayer's case was called first, but he was held by the Metis
    outside of the Court room. Other unimportant business was then taken up until one
    o'clock. An Irish relative of old Andrew McDermott, named McLaughlin, attempted to
    interfere, but was instantly suppressed. The Court then sent a suggestion to the
    Metis that they should appoint a leader with a deputation to enter the Court room
    with Sayer and state their case. This proposal was accepted, and James Sinclair, the
    English half-breed leader, undertook the duty. Sayer was then brought in, guarded by
    twenty of his compatriots, fully armed, while fifty Metis guards stood at the gates
    of the Court House enclosure. An attempt was then made to select a jury, but it was
    fruitless. Sayer next confessed that he had traded for furs with an Indian. The Court
    then gave a verdict of guilty, whereupon Sayer proved that a Hudson's Bay officer
    named Harriott, had given him authority to trade. The other three cases against the
    Metis were not proceeded with, and Governor, Recorder, officials and spectators all
    left the Court room, the mob being of the impression that the prisoners had been
    acquitted, and that trading for furs was no longer illegal. Though this was not the
    decision yet the crowd so took it up, and made<span class ="pagenum">223</span><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">
  </a> the welkin ring with shouts (Le Commerce est libre, vive la
    libert&eacute;) "Commerce is free, long live liberty."</p>
    <p>The Metis then crossed the river to St. Boniface, and after much cheering, fired
    several salutes with their guns. It was their victory, but it was one in which the
    vast mass of the English-speaking rejoiced for the bands of tyranny were broken.
    Judge Thom, under instructions from Governor Simpson, never acted as Recorder again,
    but was simply Secretary of the Court, and another reigned in his stead. After this
    the Court was largely without authority, and as has been said the rescue of prisoners
    was not an infrequent occurrence in the future life of the Settlement.

    <div class="subchap">OFF TO THE BUFFALO.
    </div>
    <p>Alexander Ross was a Scottish Highlander, who came to Glengarry in Canada, quite a
    century ago, joined Astor's expedition, went around Cape Horn and in British Columbia
    rose to be an officer in the Northwest Company. He married the daughter of an Indian
    Chief at Okanagan, came over the Rocky Mountains, and was given by Sir George Simpson
    a free gift of a farm, where Ross and James Streets are now found in Winnipeg. This
    land is to-day worth many millions of dollars. Ross was also fond of hunting the
    buffalo, and we are fortunate in having his spirited story of 1840.</p>
    <div class="subchap">BUFFALO HUNTING.
    </div>
    <p>In the leafy month of June carts were seen to emerge from every nook and corner of
    the Settlement bound for the plains. As they passed us, many things were discovered
    to be still wanting, to supply which a halt had to be made at Fort Garry shop; one
    wanted this thing, another that, but all on credit. The day of payment was yet to
    come; but payment was promised. Many on the present occasion were sup<span class ="pagenum">225</span><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>plied, many were not; they got
    and grumbled, and grumbled and got, till they could get no more; and at last went
    off, still grumbling and discontented.</p>
    <p>From Fort Garry the cavalcade and camp-followers were crowding on the public road,
    and thence, stretching from point to point, till the third day in the evening, when
    they reached Pembina, the great rendezvous of such occasions. When the hunters leave
    the Settlement it enjoys that relief which a person feels on recovering from a long
    and painful sickness. Here, on a level plain, the whole patriarchal camp squatted
    down like pilgrims on a journey to the Holy Land, in ancient days: only not so
    devout, for neither scrip nor staff were consecrated for the occasion. Here the roll
    was called, and general muster taken, when they numbered on the occasion 1,630 souls:
    and here the rules and regulations for the journey were finally settled. The
    officials for the trip were named and installed into their office, and all without
    the aid of writing materials.</p>
    <p>The camp occupied as much ground as a modern city, and was formed in a circle: all
    the carts were placed side by side, the trams outward. Within this line, the tents
    were placed in double, treble rows, at one end; the animals at the other in front of
    the tents. This is the order in all dangerous places: but when<span class ="pagenum">226</span><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a> no danger is feared, the animals are kept on the
    outside. Thus, the carts formed a strong barrier, not only for securing the people
    and the beasts of burden within, but as a place of shelter and defence against an
    attack of the enemy without.</p>
    <p>There is, however, another appendage belonging to the expedition, and to every
    expedition of the kind; and you may be assured they are not the least noisy. We
    allude to the dogs or camp followers. On the present occasion they numbered no fewer
    than 542; sufficient of themselves to consume no small number of animals a day, for,
    like their masters, they dearly relish a bit of buffalo meat.</p>
    <p>These animals are kept in summer as they are, about the establishments of the fur
    traders, for their services in the winter. In deep snows, when horses cannot
    conveniently be used, dogs are very serviceable to the hunters in these parts. The
    half-breed, dressed in his wolf costume, tackles two or three sturdy curs into a flat
    sled, throws himself on it at full length, and gets among the buffalo unperceived.
    Here the bow and arrow play their part to prevent noise; and here the skillful hunter
    kills as many as he pleases, and returns to camp without disturbing the band.</p>
    <p>But now to our camp again&mdash;the largest of its kind perhaps in the world. A
    council was held <span class ="pagenum">227</span><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a> for the
    nomination of chiefs or officers for conducting the expedition. Two captains were
    named, the senior on this occasion being Jean Baptiste Wilkie, an English half-breed
    brought up among the French, a man of good sound sense and long experience, and
    withal a bold-looking and discreet fellow, a second Nimrod in his way. Besides being
    captain, in common with others, he was styled the great war chief or head of the
    camp, and on all public occasions he occupied the place of president.</p>
    <p>The hoisting of the flag every morning is the signal for raising camp. Half an
    hour is the full time allowed to prepare for the march, but if anyone is sick, or
    their animals have strayed, notice is sent to the guide, who halts until all is made
    right. From the time the flag is hoisted however, till the hour of camping arrives,
    it is never taken down. The flag taken down is a signal for encamping, while it is up
    the guide is chief of the expedition, captains are subject to him, and the soldiers
    of the day are his messengers, he commands all. The moment the flag is lowered his
    functions cease and the captains and soldiers' duties commence. They point out the
    order of the camp, and every cart as it arrives moves to its appointed place. This
    business usually occupies about the same time as raising camp in the morning, for
    everything moves with the regularity of clockwork.<span class ="pagenum">228</span><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a> </p>
    <p>The captains and other chiefs have agreed on rules to govern the expedition, such
    as, that no buffaloes are to be run on Sunday, no party is to lag behind or to go
    before, no one may run a buffalo without a general order, etc. The punishment for
    breaking the laws are for a first offence: the offender had his saddle and bridle cut
    up: for the second, to have the coat taken off his back and cut up: for the third,
    the offender was flogged. Any theft was punished by the offender being three times
    proclaimed "THIEF," in the middle of the camp.</p>
    <p>On the 21st of June, after the priest had performed mass, for many were Roman
    Catholics, the flag was unfurled at about six or seven o'clock and the picturesque
    line was formed over the prairie, extending some five or six miles towards the
    southwest. It was the ninth was gained. This was a journey of about 150 day from
    Pembina before the Cheyenne River miles, and on the nineteenth day, at a distance of
    250 miles, the destined hunting grounds were reached. On the 4th of July, since the
    encampment was in the United States, the compliment was paid of having the first
    buffalo race.</p>
    <p>No less than 400 huntsmen, all mounted and anxiously waiting for the word "Start,"
    took up their position in a line at one end of the camp, while Captain Wilkie issued
    his orders.</p>

 <span class ="pagenum">229</span><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>
   <p>At eight o'clock the whole cavalcade broke ground, and made for the buffaloes.
    When the horsemen started the buffaloes were about a mile and a half distant, but
    when they approached to about four or five hundred yards, the bulls curled their
    tails or pawed the ground. In a moment more the herd took flight, and horse and rider
    are presently seen bursting upon them, shots are heard, and all is smoke, dust and
    hurry, and in less time than we have occupied with a description a thousand carcasses
    strew the plain.</p>
    <p>When the rush was made, the earth seemed to tremble as the horses started, but
    when the animals fled, it was like the shock of an earthquake. The air was darkened,
    the rapid firing, at first, soon became more and more faint, and at last died away in
    the distance.</p>
    <p>In such a run, a good horse and experienced rider will select and kill from ten to
    twelve buffaloes at one heat, but in the case before us, the surface was rocky and
    full of badger holes. Twenty-three horses and riders were at one moment all sprawling
    on the ground, one horse gored by a bull, was killed on the spot, two more were
    disabled by the fall. One rider broke his shoulder blade, another burst his gun, and
    lost three fingers by the accident, another was struck on the knee by an exhausted
    bull. In the evening no less than 1,375 tongues were brought into<span class ="pagenum">230</span><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a> camp. When the run is over the hunter's work is now
    retrograde. The last animal killed is the first skinned, and night not unfrequently,
    surprises the runner at his work. What then remains is lost and falls to the wolves.
    Hundreds of dead buffaloes are often abandoned, for even a thunderstorm, in one hour,
    will render the meat useless.</p>
    <p>The day of a race is as fatiguing on the hunter as on the horse, but the meat well
    in the camp, he enjoys the very luxury of idleness.</p>
    <p>Then the task of the women begins, who do all the rest, and what with skins, and
    meat and fat, their duty is a most laborious one.</p>
    <p>It is to be regretted that much of the meat is wasted. Our expedition killed not
    less than 2,500 buffaloes, and out of all these made 375 bags of pemmican, and 240
    bales of dried meat; 750 animals should have made that amount, so that a great
    quantity was wasted. Of course, the buffalo skins were saved and had their value.</p>
    <p>Our party were now on the Missouri and encamped there. A few traders went to the
    nearest American fort, and bartered furs for articles they needed.</p>
    <p>After passing a week on the banks of the Missouri we turned to the West, when we
    had a few races with various success. We were afterwards led backwards and forwards
    at the pleasure of the buffalo herds. They crossed and recrossed<span class ="pagenum">231</span><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a> our path until we had travelled to almost every
    point of the compass.</p>
    <p>Having had various altercations with the Indians, the party reached Red River,
    bringing about 900 lbs. of buffalo meat in each cart, making more than one million
    pounds in all. The Hudson's Bay Company took a considerable amount of this, and the
    remainder went to supply the wants of the Red River Settlement for another year.

    <div class="subchap">WHAT THE STARGAZERS SAW.
    </div>
    <p>The writer remembers meeting in Boston, a good many years ago, a scientific
    explorer, who along with two companies, one of whom is the greatest astronomer in the
    United States, as an astronomical party in 1860, made a visit through Red River
    Settlement, on their way to the North Saskatchewan to observe an eclipse. The
    disappointment of the party was very great, for, after travelling three thousand
    miles, their fate was "to sit in a marsh and view the eclipse through the clouds, so
    heavy was the rain."</p>
    <p>The three astronomers have given their account under assumed names in a little
    book, of which there are few copies in Canada. Their view of Red River Settlement in
    1860 is a vivid picture.</p>
    <p>What an extraordinary Settlement! Here is a Colony of about ten thousand souls
    scattered among plantations for thirty miles along the Red and half as many along the
    Assiniboine River, almost wholly dependent for intelligence<span class ="pagenum">233</span><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a> from the outer world on one stern-wheeled steamer.
    That breaks down; and before word can be sent of their complete isolation, weeks must
    pass before the old and painful canoe-route by way of Lake of the Woods can be
    opened, or the wagon make its tedious journey to the headwaters of the Red and back,
    improvising on the way its own ferries over the swift and deep streams which feed
    it.</p>
    <p>Finding haste of no avail, and despatching our luggage on carts to the Upper Fort
    and centre of the Settlement, twenty miles away, we start there on foot the next day
    to view the land and its inhabitants. The road, "the King's road," is a mere
    cart-track in the deep loam, taking its independent course on either side of the
    houses, all of which front the river in a single wavering line; for the country is
    given up absolutely to farming, for which the rich mould, said to be three or four
    feet deep, eminently fits it; and the lots each with a narrow frontage at the bank of
    the river, extends back two miles into the prairie. All is at a dead level. John
    Omand had asked us to dine at his house; but accidentally passing it without
    recognizing it from his description, we select a fair representative of the common
    class of houses, and ask for dinner. It is a log-cabin, like all of this class (some
    far better ones have walls of stone) with a thatched roof and a rough stone and
    mortar<span class ="pagenum">234</span><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a> chimney planted against
    one wall. Inside is but a single room, well whitewashed, as is indeed the outside and
    exceptionally tidy; a bed occupies one corner, a sort of couch another, a rung ladder
    leads up to loose boards overhead which form an attic, a trap door in the middle of
    the room opens to a small hole in the ground where milk and butter are kept cool;
    from the beam is suspended a hammock, used as a cradle for the baby; shelves
    singularly hung held a scanty stock of plates, knives and forks; two windows on
    either side, covered with mosquito netting, admit the light, and a modicum of air;
    chests and boxes supply the place of seats, with here and there a keg by way of
    easy-chair. An open fireplace of whitewashed clay gives sign of cheer and warmth in
    the long winter, and a half-dozen books for library complete the scene.</p>
    <p>Our hosts feel so "highly honored to have such gentlemen enter the
    house"&mdash;these are their very words&mdash;that it is with the greatest difficulty
    they are forced to take any compensation for the excellent meal of bread, butter, and
    rich cream which they set before us, and to which we do ample justice.</p>
    <p>This was not the only interior we saw; we had before called on the single
    scientific man of the Settlement, Donald Gunn, and later in the day are forced by a
    thunderstorm to seek shelter in the nearest house; where we are also warmly
<span class ="pagenum">235</span><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a> welcomed, and the rain
    continuing, are glad to accept the cordial invitations of its inhabitants to pass the
    night. This is a larger house, but only the father of the family and his buxom
    daughter, Susie, a lively girl of eighteen or nineteen, are at home, the others being
    off at the other end of their small farm, where they have temporary shelter during
    the harvest.</p>
    <p>We have each a chamber to ourselves in the garret, reached in the same primitive
    method as before mentioned&mdash;and are shown with a dip of buffalo-tallow to our
    rooms. The furniture of these consists of a sort of couch, with buffalo skins for
    mattress and wolf skins for sheets and coverlet, a chest for a seat, a punch-bowl of
    water on a broken chair for a washstand, and a torn bit of rag for towel; while a
    barrel covered with a white cloth serves as a centre-table, and is besprinkled with
    antique books. Among those in his chamber our naturalist discovers one which appears
    to be a catechism of human knowledge containing, among other entertaining and
    instructive information as an answer to the question, "What is a shark?" the highly
    satisfactory reply that it is "An animal having eighty-eight teeth."</p>
    <p>The wants of the Colony were few, the peasantry simple and industrious, and their
    lot in life did not seem to them hard. The earth yielded bountifully, and in time of
    temporary<span class ="pagenum">236</span><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a> disaster fishing and
    hunting stood them in good stead. When they hunt, they go accompanied by Indians, who
    live on the outskirts of the Colony. Further and further they have been compelled to
    go, until at our visit no buffalo could be found within a hundred miles at
    nearest.</p>
    <p>The hunt is just over as we reach the Settlement, and every day carts come in
    laden with the buffalo meat, hides, and pemmican. The prairie, back from the river,
    by Fort Garry, is dotted with carts, lodges and tents. Many are living in rude
    shelters formed of the carts themselves, placed back to back, and the sides secured
    by hides.</p>
    <p>These carts illustrate well the primitive nature and the isolation of the Colony.
    They are the vehicles in universal use, and are built on the general pattern of our
    one-horse tip-carts, though they do not tip, and not a scrap of iron enters into
    them. They are without springs, of course, and rawhide and wooden pins serve to keep
    together the pieces out of which they are constructed. As they have no tires, and the
    section of the wheel part or crowd together, according to the moisture, a train of
    these carts bringing in the products of the hunt is a strange sight. Each cart has
    its own peculiar creak, hoarse and grating, and waggles its own individual waggle,
    graceless and shaky, on the uneven ground. To add to its oddity, the shafts
<span class ="pagenum">237</span><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a> are heavy, straight beams,
    between which is harnessed an ox, the harness of rawhide (shaga-nappi) without
    buckles.</p>
    <p>Everybody makes for himself what he wishes in this undifferentiated Settlement. We
    return in tatters. Not a tailor, nor anything approaching the description of one,
    exists here, and a week's search is needed to discover such a being as a shoemaker. A
    single store in the Hudson's Bay post at each of the two forts, twenty miles apart,
    supplies the goods of the outside world, and the purchaser must furnish the
    receptacle for carriage. For small goods this invariably consists, as far as we can
    see, of a red bandanna handkerchief, so that purchases have to be small and frequent;
    not all of one sort, however, for the native can readily tie up his tea in one
    corner, his sugar and buttons in two others, and still have one left for normal uses.
    How many handkerchiefs a day are put to use may be judged from the fact that the
    average sale of tea at Upper Fort Garry is four large boxes daily&mdash;all, be it
    remembered, brought by ship to Hudson Bay, and thence by batteaux and portage to the
    Red River.</p>
    <p>The caravan by which we and a number of others were carried back to civilization
    was a stylish enough turnout for Red River. It was supplied by McKinney, the host of
    the Royal Hotel of the village of Winnipeg. Three large<span class ="pagenum">238</span><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a> emigrant wagons, with canvas coverings of the most
    approved pattern, but of very different hues, drawn each by a yoke of oxen, convey
    the patrons of the party, with the exception of a miner, who rides his horse. The
    astronomers take the lead under a brown canvas; a theological student for Toronto
    University, a gentleman for St. Paul, and others follow under a black canvas full of
    holes; and the third wagon with a cover of spotless purity, conveys the ladies of the
    party and a clergyman. Behind them follow not only half a dozen Red River carts, with
    a most promiscuous assortment of baggage, peltry, and squeak, but also a stray ox and
    a pony or two; a number of armed horsemen, and for the first day a cavalcade of
    friends giving a Scotch convoy to those who were departing. The astronomers at length
    reached St. Paul, when they declare their connection with the world again complete,
    after an absence of about three months, during which they had travelled thirty-five
    hundred miles.<span class ="pagenum">239</span><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a></p>

    <p>Shakespeare's play of "As You Like It" is an eulogy of the flight from the highly
    formal life of city life to the simplicity of the forest and the retirement of the
    plains. Even in the banished Duke, there is a strain of oddity and quaintness. Not
    many years after the middle of last century, a Detroit lawyer fled from the troubles
    of society and city life to the peaceful plains of secluded Assiniboia. Marrying,
    after his arrival, a daughter of one of our best native families, and on her death, a
    pure Indian woman, he reared a large family. The poetic spirit of Frank Larned was

    <div class="subchap">BRITAIN'S ONE UTOPIA&mdash;SELKIRKIA.
    </div>
    <p>That brave old Englishman, Thomas More&mdash;afterwards, unhappily for his
    head&mdash;Lord High Chancellor of England&mdash;wrote out, in fair La<span class ="pagenum">240</span><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>tin,&mdash;in his chambers in
    the City of London, over three centuries ago&mdash;his idea of an Utopia. This,
    modest as are its requirements, has yet found no practical illustration, even among
    the many seats of the great colonizing race of mankind.</p>
    <p>The primitive history of all the colonies that faced the Atlantic&mdash;when the
    new-found continent first felt the abiding foot of the stranger&mdash;from Oglethorpe
    to Acadia, reveals, alas! no Utopia. It remained for a later time,&mdash;the earlier
    half of the present century, amid some severity of climate, and under conditions
    without precedent, and incapable of repetition,&mdash;to evolve a community in the
    heart of the continent, shut away from intercourse with civilized mankind&mdash;that
    slowly crystalized into a form beyond the ideal of the dreamers&mdash;a community, in
    the past, known but slightly to the outer world as the Red River Settlement, which is
    but the bygone name for the one Utopia of Britain&mdash;the clear-cut impress of an
    exceptional people living under conditions of excellence unthought of by themselves
    until they had passed away.</p>
    <div class="subchap">THE UTOPIAN COLONY.
    </div>
    <p>A people, whose name in the vast domain, was in days by gone, sought out and
    coveted by all. Unknown races had rested here and gone away,<span class ="pagenum">241</span><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a> leaving only their careful graves behind them. The
    "Mandans"&mdash;the brave, the fair, the beautiful, and the "Cheyennes," pressed by
    the "Nay-he-owuk," and the "Assin-a-pau-tuk," had quitted their earthen forts on the
    banks of the streams and urged their way to the broader tide of the Missouri. More
    fatal to the conquerors came afterward, the white man, "Nemesis" of all Indian life,
    spying with the instinct of his race, a spot of abounding fertility, where the great
    water-reaches stretched from the mountains to the sea, and southward touched almost
    the beginning of the great River of the Gulf.</p>
    <p>Quick changing his errant camp for barter into a stronghold for the trade, making
    the "Niste-y-ak" of the "Crees" his settled home, the white man's grasp of the fair
    domain but grew with years. From the seas of the far north came with the men,
    fair-haired, blue-eyed women and children. The glamour of the spot, the teeming soil,
    the great and lesser game, that swam past,&mdash;or wandered by their
    doors&mdash;soon drew to this Mecca of the Plains and Waters&mdash;the roving,
    scattered children of the trade&mdash;Bourgeois and voyageur alike heading their
    lithe and dusky broods. Here touched and fused all habitudes of life, the blended
    races, knit by ties conserving every divergence of pursuit, all forms of faith and
    thought, free from assail or taint begotten of contact with aught<span class ="pagenum">242</span><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a> other than themselves. A people whose unchecked
    primal freedom was afterward strengthened by the light hand of laws that conserved
    what they most desired; whose personal relations with their rulers were of such
    primitive character as to make the Government in every sense paternal; the petty tax
    on imports attending its administration one practically unfelt!</p>
    <p>A people whose land was dotted with schools and churches, to whose maintenance
    their contributions were so slight as to be unworthy of mention. The three separate
    religious denominations, holding widely different tenets&mdash;elsewhere the cause of
    bitter sectarian feeling,&mdash;was with them so unthought of as to give where all
    topics were eagerly sought&mdash;no room for even fireside discussion. Side by side,
    "upon the voyage,"&mdash;as they termed their lake or inland trips&mdash;the Catholic
    and the Protestant knelt and offered up their devotions&mdash;following the ways of
    their fathers,&mdash;no more to be made a subject of dispute than a difference in
    color or height.</p>
    <p>The cursings and obscenities that taint the air and brutalize life elsewhere, were
    in this quaint old settlement unknown. Sweet thought, pure speech, went hand in hand,
    clad in nervous, pithy old English, or a "patois" of the French, mellowed and
    enlarged by their constant use of<span class ="pagenum">243</span><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">
  </a> the liquid Indian tongues, flowing like soft-sounding waters about
    them, their daily talk came ever welcome to the ear.</p>
    <div class="subchap">AN ARCADIA.
    </div>
    <p>Where locks for doors were unknown, or, known, unused, where a man's word, even in
    the transfer of land, was held as his bond&mdash;honesty became a necessity. Lawyers
    were none. Law was held to be a danger. Still the importance attached by simple minds
    to an appearance in public, the amusing belief cherished by some, that, if permitted
    to plead his own case, exert his unsuspected powers, there could be but one result,
    brought some honest souls to the Red River forum, with matter of much moment, "the
    like never heard before." None can read the quaint, minutely-detailed record of these
    "causes cel&eacute;bres" that shook the little households as with a great wind,
    without a smile, or resist the conviction that no scheme of an English Utopia can
    safely be pronounced perfect without some such modest tribunal to afford vent for
    that ever-germinating desire for battle inherent in the race.</p>

    <p>Their manners were natural, cordial, and full of a lightsome heartness that robed
    accost with sunshine,&mdash;a quietude withal&mdash;that rare quality &mdash;that
    irked them not at all&mdash;one gathered from their Indian kin-folk. Their knowledge
    of each<span class ="pagenum">244</span><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a> other was simply
    universal&mdash;their kin ties almost as general. These ties were brightened and
    friendships reknit in the holiday season of the year, the leisure of the long
    winters, when the far-scattered hewn log houses&mdash;small to the eye&mdash;were
    ever found large enough to hold the welcome arrivals,&mdash;greeted with a kiss that
    said,<span class ="pagenum">245</span><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a> "I am of your blood."
    These widespread affiliations broke down aught like "caste." Wealth or official
    position were practically unheeded by a people in no fear of want and unaccustomed to
    luxuries, who sought their kinswoman and her brood for themselves, not for what they
    had in store. The children and grandchildren of men, however assured in fortune or
    position, wove anew equalizing ties, seeking out their mates as they came to hand;
    hence a genial, not a downward level, putting to shame fine-spun theories of
    democracy in other lands&mdash;spun, not worn.</p>
    <p>This satisfaction of station&mdash;as said&mdash;grew out of the slight exertion
    necessary for all the wants of life, with unlimited choice of the finest land on the
    continent; the waters alive with fish and aquatic fowl; rabbits and prairie fowl at
    times by actual cart-load; elk not far, and countless buffalo
    behind,&mdash;furnishing meat, bedding, clothing and shoes to any who could muster a
    cart or go in search; the woods and plains in season, ripe with delicious wild fruit,
    for present use or dried for winter,&mdash;the whole backed by abundant breadstuffs.
    The quota of the farmers along the rivers, whose fertile banks were dotted by
    windmills, whose great arms stayed the inconstant winds, and yoked the fickle
    couriers to the great car of general plenty.<span class ="pagenum">246</span><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">
  </a> </p><div class="subchap">A LAND OF PEACE.
    </div>
    <p>Poverty in one sense certainly existed; age and improvidence are always with us,
    but it was not obtrusive, made apparent only towards the close of the long winter,
    when some old veteran of the canoe or saddle would make a "grand promenade" through
    the Settlement, with his ox and sled, making known his wants, incidentally, at his
    different camps among his old friends, finding always before he left his sled made
    the heavier by the women's hands. This was simply done; few in the wild country but
    had met with sudden exigencies in supply, knew well the need at times of one man to
    another, and, when asked for aid, gave willingly. Or it may be that some
    large-hearted, jovial son of the chase had overrated his winter store, or underrated
    the assiduity of his friends. His recourse in such case being the more carefully
    estimated stock of some neighbor, who could in no wise suffer the reproach to lie at
    his door, that he had turned his back, in such emergence, upon his good-natured, if
    injudicious countryman.</p>
    <p>This practical communism&mdash;borrowed from the Indians, among whom it was
    inviolable&mdash;was, in the matter of hospitality, the rule of all, &mdash;a
    reciprocation of good offices, in the absence of all houses of public entertainment,
    becoming<span class ="pagenum">247</span><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a> a social necessity.
    The manner of its exercise hearty, a knitting of the people together,&mdash;no one
    was at a loss for a winter camp when travelling. Every house he saw was his own, the
    bustling wife, with welcome in her eyes, eager to assure your comfort. The supper
    being laid and dealt sturdily with, the good man's pipe and your own alight and
    breathing satisfaction, &mdash;a neighbor soul drops in to swell the gale of talk,
    that rocks you at last into a restful sleep. How now, my masters! Smacks not this of
    Arcady?</p>
    <p>Early and universal marriage was the rule. Here you received the blessings of home
    in the married life, and the care of offspring. There were thus no defrauded
    women&mdash;called, by a cruel irony, "old maids"; no isolated, mistaken men, cheated
    out of themselves, and robbed of the best training possible for man. This vital fact
    was fraught with every good.</p>
    <p>On the young birds leaving the parent nest, they only exchanged it for one near at
    hand&mdash;land for the taking; a house to be built, a wife to be got&mdash;a share
    of the stock, some tools and simple furniture, and the outfit was complete. The
    youngest son remained at home to care for the old father and mother, and to him came
    the homestead when they were laid away. The conditions were all faithful, home life
    dear indeed.<span class ="pagenum">248</span><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a> </p>
    <p>To the Hunters accepting their fall in the chase no wilder thought could scarce be
    broached than that of solicitude as to the future of their young. Boys who sat a
    horse almost as soon as they could walk, whose earliest plaything was a bow and
    arrows; girls as apt in other ways, happy; sustained in their environment with a
    faith truly simple and reverent.</p>
    <p>With so large an infusion of Norse blood and certain traditions anent "usquebae"
    and "barley bree" it would&mdash;with so large a liberty&mdash;be naturally expected,
    a liberal proportion of drouthy souls, but with an abundance of what cheers and
    distinctly inebriates in their midst they were a temperate people in its best sense,
    with no tippling houses to daily tempt them astray their supplies of spirits were
    nearly always for festive occasions. "Regales" after a voyage or weddings that lasted
    for days, and these at times under such guard as may be imagined from the presence of
    a custodian of the bottle, who exercised with what skill he might his certainly
    arduous task of determining instantly when hilarity grew into excess.</p>
    <p>This novel feature applies, however, almost entirely to the English-speaking part
    of the people. The Gallic and Indian blood of the Hunters disdained such poor toying
    with a single cherry and drank and danced and drank and danced again with an abandon,
    an ardor and<span class ="pagenum">249</span><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a> full surrender to
    the hour characteristic alike of the strength of the heads, the lightness of their
    heels and the contempt of any restraint whatever.</p>
    <p>These were, however, but the occasional and generous symposiums of health and
    vigor that rejects of itself continued indulgence. Our Utopia would be cold and
    pallid indeed lacking such expression of redundant strength, and joyful vigor.</p>
    <p>Certainly the greatest negative blessing that this exceptional people enjoyed, was
    that they had no politics, no vote. The imagination of the average "party man" sinks
    to conceive a thing like to this; yet, if an astounding fact to others, no more
    gracious one can be conceived for them selves. In the unbroken peace in which they
    lived politics would be but throwing the apple of discord in their midst, an
    innoculation of disease that they might in the delirium that marked its progress
    vehemently discuss remedies to allay it.</p>
    <p>Another great negative advantage was the peculiar and admirable intelligence of
    the great body of the population. The small circulating collection of books in their
    midst attracting little or no attention, their own limited to a Bible or prayer
    book,&mdash;many not these. With their minds in this normal healthy state, unharassed
    by the sordid assail of care, undepressed by any<span class ="pagenum">250</span><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">
  </a> sense whatever of inferiority, unfrayed by the trituration of the
    average book, their powers of apprehension&mdash;singularly clear&mdash;had full
    scope to appropriate and resolve the world about them, which they did to such purpose
    as to master every exigence of their lives. Seizing upon the minutest detail
    affecting them they mastered as if by intuition all difficult handiwork, making with
    but few tools every thing they required from a windmill to a horseshoe.</p>
    <p>Their real education was in scenes of travel or adventure in the great unbroken
    regions sought out by the fur trade, their retentive memories reproducing by the
    winter fireside or summer camp pictures so graphic as to commend themselves to every
    ear.</p>
    <p>The tender heart and true of the brave old knight, Sir Thomas More, put a ban upon
    hunting in his Utopia. Alas and alack for the wayward proclivities of our Utopians,
    predaceous creatures all, hunting was to them as the breath of their nostrils, for to
    them, unlike the sons of Adam, it was given&mdash;with their brothers resting upon
    the tranquil river&mdash;to lay upon the altar of their homes alike the fruits of the
    earth and the spoils of the chase.</p>
    <div class="subchap">THE BUFFALO HUNT.</div>

    gathering<span class ="pagenum">251</span><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a> of the mighty
    Halfbreed clan going forth&mdash;each spring and fall&mdash;in a tumult of carts and
    horsemen to their boundless preserves, the home of the buffaloes, whose outrangers
    were the grizzly bear, the branching elk, the flying antelope that skirted the great
    columns, the last relieving the heavy rolling gait of the herds by a speed and airy
    flight that mocked the eye to follow them, scouting the dull trot of the prowling
    wolves&mdash;attent upon the motions of their best purveyor&mdash;man.</p>
    <p>What a going forth was theirs! this array of Hunters, with their wives and little
    ones; this new tribe clad in semi-savage garniture, streaming across the plains with
    cries of glee and joyance; the riders in their "travoie" of arms and horse
    equipment&mdash;the vast "brigade" of carts and bands of following horses, kept to
    the cavalcade by those reckless jubilants&mdash;the boys&mdash;seeming a part of the
    creatures they bestrode. The sunshine and the flying fleecy clouds, emulous in motion
    with the troop below: what life was in it all; what freedom and what breadth!</p>
    <p>And as the sun sank apace and the guides and Headmen rode apart on some
    o'er-looking height and reined their cattle in, the closing up of the flying squadron
    for the evening camp, the great circular camp of these our Scythians proof against
    sudden raid crowning the land<span class ="pagenum">252</span><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>scape far and wide, seen, yet seeing every foe, whose subtle coming
    through the short-lived night was watched by eyes as keen as were their own.</p>
    <p>When reached, their bellowing, countless quarry: the plain alive and trembling
    with their tumult, what tournament of mail-clad knights but was as a stilted play to
    this rude shock of man and beast&mdash;carrying in a cloud of dust that hid alike the
    chaser and the chased, till done their work the frightened herds swept onward and
    away, leaving the sward flecked with the huge forms that made the hunters' wealth!
    And now! on: fall prosaic from the wild charge, the danger of the fierce
    <i>melee</i>!&mdash;drifting from the camp the carts appear piled red in a trice with
    bosses, tongues, back fat and juicy haunch, a feast unknown to hapless kings.</p>
    <p>We but glance at this great feature, that fed so fat our Utopia, leaving to
    imagination the return, the trade, the feasting and the fiddle when lusty legs
    embossed by "quills" or beads kept up the dance.</p>
    <p>The outcome of the "Plain Hunt" was not only a wide spread plenty among the
    Hunters on reaching the quiet farmer folk upon the rivers, but also the diffusion of
    a sunshine, a tone of generous serenity that sat well on the chivalry of the
    chase&mdash;the bold riders of the Plain.<span class ="pagenum">253</span><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">

    atmospheres hues with a wealth of sunshine the great reaching spaces of verdure
    covered with flowers in a profusion rivaling their exquisite beauty. Green waving
    copses dot the level sward, and rob the sky line of its sea-like sweep. The winding
    rivers, signalled by their wooded banks, upon which rest the comfortable homes of the
    dwellers in the "hidden land" guarding their little fields close by where the ranked
    grain standing awaits the sickle, turning from green to gold and so unhurried
    resting. The shining cattle couched outside in ruminant content or cropping lazily
    the succulent feast spread wide before them; the horses wary of approach, just seen
    in compact bands upon the verge; the patriarchal windmills&mdash;at wide
    spaces&mdash;signalling to each other their peaceful task; the little groups of
    horsemen coming adown the winding road, or stopping to greet some good wife and her
    gossip&mdash;going abroad in a high-railed cart in quest of trade, or friendly call.

    </div>
    <p>Lord Selkirk's Colonists never had, as have seen, a bed of roses. Adversity had
    dodged their steps from the time that they put the first foot forward toward the new
    world&mdash;and Stornoway, Fort Churchill, York Factory, Norway House, Pembina and
    Fort Douglas start, as we speak of them, a train of bitter memories. Flood and
    famine, attack and bloodshed, toil and anxiety were the constant atmosphere, in which
    for a generation they existed. Higher civilization is impossible when the struggle
    for shelter and bread is too strenuous. Though the ministrations of religion were
    supplied within a few years of the beginning of the Colony, yet the Colonists were
    not satisfied in this respect till forty years had passed. It was a generation before
    the Roman Catholic Church had a Bishop, who held the See of St. Boniface instead of
    the title "in the parts of the heathen." It was not before the year 1849 that a
    Church of England Bishop arrived, and it was two years after that date when the first
    Presbyter<span class ="pagenum">257</span><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>ian minister came to
    be the spiritual head of the Selkirk Colonists. Before this the education and
    elevation of the people was represented by a few schools chiefly maintained by
    private or church effort. The writer intends to bring out, from selected quotations
    from different sources, the few bright spots in the gloom&mdash;the pictures of
    silver&mdash;on a rather dark background.</p>
    <div class="subchap">ABBE DUGAS' STORY.
    </div>
    <p>The good Father's story circles around the first Canadian woman known to have
    reached Red River. This was Marie Gaboury, wife of J. Baptiste Lajimoniere, who
    reached the Forks in 1811 in the very year when the Colonists were lying at York
    Factory. The Lajimonieres spent the winter in Pembina. It was the brave husband of
    Marie Gaboury who made the long and lonely journey from Red River to Montreal. The
    Abbe says: "J.B. Lajimoniere was engaged by the Governor of Fort Douglas to carry
    letters to Lord Selkirk, who was then in Montreal. Lajimoniere said he could go alone
    to Montreal, and that he would make every effort to put the letters confided to his
    care into Lord Selkirk's hands. Being alone, Madame Lajimoniere left the hut on the
    banks of the Assiniboine to become an inmate of Fort Douglas. Lajimoniere is reported
    to have urged upon Lord Selkirk in Montreal to send as<span class ="pagenum">258</span><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a> part of his recompense for his long journey, a
    priest to be the guide of himself and family. Father Dugas says: (See printed page
    2.)</p>
    <p>"Lord Selkirk before his departure had made the Catholic colony on the Red River
    sign a petition asking the Bishop of Quebec to send missionaries to evangelize the
    country. He presented this petition himself and employed all his influence to have it
    granted.</p>
    <p>"Though a Protestant Lord Selkirk knew that to found a permanent colony on the Red
    River he required the encouragement of religion. Should his application succeed the
    missionaries would come with the voyageurs in the following spring and would arrive
    in Red River towards the month of July. This thought alone made Madame Lajimoniere
    forget her eleven years of loneliness and sorrow.</p>
    <p>"Before July the news had spread that the missionaries were coming that very
    summer, but as yet the exact date of their arrival was not known. Telegraphs had not
    reached this region and moreover the voyageurs were often exposed to delays.</p>
    <p>"After waiting patiently, one beautiful morning on the 16th of July, the day of
    Our Lady of Mount Carmel, a man came from the foot of the river to warn Fort Douglas
    and the neighborhood that two canoes bringing the missionaries were coming up the
    river, and that all the<span class ="pagenum">259</span><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a> people
    ought to be at the Fort to receive them on their arrival.</p>
    <p>"Scarcely was the news made known when men, women and children hurried to the
    Fort. Those who had never seen the priests were anxious to contemplate these men of
    God of whom they had heard so much. Madame Lajimoniere was not the last to hasten to
    the place where the missionaries would land. She took all her little ones with her,
    the eldest of whom was Reine, then eleven years old.</p>
    <p>"Towards the hour of noon on a beautiful clear day more than one hundred and fifty
    persons were gathered on the river bank in front of Fort Douglas. Every eye was on
    the turn of the river at the point. It was who should first see the voyageurs.
    Suddenly two canoes bearing the Company's flag came in sight. There was a general
    shout of joy. The trader of the Fort, Mr. A. McDonald, was a Catholic, and he had
    everything prepared to give them a solemn reception. Many shed tears of joy. The
    memory of their native land was recalled to the old Canadians who had left their
    homes many years before. These old voyageurs who had been constantly called upon to
    face death had been deprived of all religious succour during the long years, but they
    had not been held by a spirit of impiety. The missionaries were to them the
    messengers of God.<span class ="pagenum">260</span><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a> </p>
    <p>"The canoes landed in front of Fort Douglas, M. Provencher and his companion both
    invested in their cassocks stepped on shore and were welcomed with outstretched hands
    by this family, which was henceforth to be theirs.</p>
    <p>"They were admired for their manly figures as much as for the novelty of their
    costumes. M. Provencher and his companion, M. Severe Dumoulin, were both men of great
    stature and both had a majestic carriage. They stood at the top of the bank and after
    making the women and children sit down around them M. Provencher addressed some words
    to this multitude gathered about him. He spoke very simply and in a fatherly manner.
    Madame Lajimoniere who had not listened to the voice of a priest for twelve years
    could hardly contain herself for joy. She cried with happiness and forgetting all her
    hardships, fancied herself for a moment in the dear parish of Maskinong&eacute; where
    she had spent such happy peaceful years.</p>
    <p>"The missionaries arrived on Thursday, July 16th. M. Provencher having made known
    to his new family the aim of his mission wished immediately to begin teaching them
    the lessons of Christianity and to bring into the fold the sheep which were
    outside.</p>
    <p>"While waiting till a house could be built for the missionaries, M. Provencher and
    his companion were hospitably entertained at the Fort<span class ="pagenum">261</span><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a> of the Colony. A large room in one of the buildings
    of the Fort had been set apart for them, and it was there that they held divine
    service. M. Provencher invited all the mothers of families to bring their children
    who were under six years of age to the Fort on the following Saturday when they would
    receive the happiness of being baptised. All persons above that age who were not
    Christians could not receive that sacrament until after being instructed in the
    truths of Christianity.</p>
    <p>"When M. Provencher had finished speaking the Governor conducted him with M.
    Dumoulin into the Fort. Canadians, Metis and Indians feeling very happy retired to
    return three days afterwards.</p>
    <p>"There were four children in the Lajimoniere family, but only two of them could be
    baptised, the others being nine and eleven years of age. On the following Saturday
    Madame Lajimoniere with all the other women came to the Fort. The number of children,
    including Indians and Metis, amounted to a hundred and Madame Lajimoniere being the
    only Christian woman stood Godmother to them all. For a long time all the children in
    the colony called her 'Marraine.'</p>
    <p>"M. Provencher announced that from the next day the missionaries would begin their
    work and that the settlers ought to begin at the<span class ="pagenum">262</span><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">
  </a> same time to work at the erection of a home for them.</p>
    <p>"M. Lajimoniere was one of the first to meet at the place selected and to commence
    preparing the materials for the building. The work progressed so rapidly that the
    house was ready for occupation by the end of October.</p>
    <p>"Madame Lajimoniere rendered every assistance in her power to the
    missionaries."</p>
    <div class="subchap">HARGRAVE'S TALE.
    </div>
    <p>With a few changes we shall allow an old friend of the writer, J.J. Hargrave, long
    an official of the Hudson's Bay Company, to give the tale of the Church of England in
    Red River Settlement. "As we have seen, the Rev. John West came from England to Red
    River as chaplain of the Hudson's Bay Company. One of his first works was the
    erection of a rude school-house, and the systematic education of a few children.
    Chief among the names of the clergymen, who came out from England in the early days
    of the Settlement, after Mr. West's return, were Rev. Messrs. Jones, Cochran, Cowley,
    McCallum, Smedhurst, James and Hunter. William Cochran is universally regarded in the
    Colony as the founder of the English Church in Rupert's Land, and from the date of
    his arrival till 1849 all the principal ecclesiastical business done may be said to
<span class ="pagenum">263</span><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a> have received its impetus from
    his personal energy. The church in which he began his ministrations was replaced by
    the present Cathedral of St. John's. Mr. Cochran then built the first church in St.
    Andrew's, at the Rapids, and besides gathered the Indians together and erected their
    church at St. Peter's."</p>
    <p>In 1849 arrived Bishop David Anderson, an Oxford man. He settled at St. John's,
    now in the City of Winnipeg, and occupied "Bishop's Court." After occupying the See
    for fifteen years, he retired, and was succeeded by Bishop Machray, whose commanding
    figure was known to all early settlers in Winnipeg. He revived St. John's College and
    gained fame as an educationalist.</p>
    <p>The peculiarly situated nature of the Settlement, extending in a long line of
    isolated houses along the banks of the river, and in no place stretching back any
    distance on the prairies, render a succession of churches necessary to bring the
    opportunity of attending within the reach of the people. Ten Church of England places
    of worship exist (1870) on the bank of the river. Of these, eight are within the
    legally defined limits of the Colony.</p>
    <p>About the middle of December, 1866, Archdeacon John McLean commenced the
    celebration of the Church of England service in the village of Winnipeg. The services
    were for a<span class ="pagenum">264</span><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a> time held in the
    Court House at Fort Garry, and in the autumn of 1868 Holy Trinity Church was opened
    in Winnipeg.</p>
    <div class="subchap">A SELF-DENYING APOSTLE.
    </div>
    <p>After many disappointments the cry of the Selkirk Colonists for a minister of
    their own faith reached Scotland, and their case was referred to Dr. Robert Burns, of
    Toronto, who was further urged to action by Governor Ballenden, of Fort Garry. In
    August, 1851, the Rev. John Black, then newly ordained, was sent on by Dr. Burns to
    Red River. He was fortunate in becoming attached to a military expedition led by
    Governor Ramsey, of Minnesota, going northwest for nearly four hundred miles, from
    St. Paul to Pembina.</p>
    <p>Leaving the military escort behind, in company with Mr. Bond, who wrote an account
    of the trip, Mr. Black floated down Red River in a birch canoe, and in a three-days'
    journey they reached the Marion's House in St. Boniface. It is said that it was from
    Bond's description of this voyage that the Poet Whittier obtained the information for
    the well-known poem.</p>

    <p>In the afternoon of the day of their arrival the party crossed from St. Boniface
    to Fort Garry, and the missionary well known as Rev. Dr. Black, went to the
    hospitable shelter of Alexander Ross, whose daughter he afterward married. Three
    hundred of the Selkirk Colonists and their children immediately gathered around Mr.
    Black, and though interrupted for a year by the great flood which we have described,
    erected in the following year, the stone Church of Kildonan, on the highway some five
    miles from Winnipeg. With the help of a small grant from the Hudson's Bay Company,
    the Selkirk Colonists erected, free from debt, their church which still remains. Two
    other churches were erected by the Presbyterians, and beside each a school. For
    several years before the old Colony ceased Mr. Black conducted service in the Court
    House near Fort Garry, and in 1868, with the assistance of Cana<span class ="pagenum">267</span><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>dian friends, erected the small Knox Church on
    Portage Avenue, in Winnipeg. This building, though used, was not completed till after
    the arrival of the Canadian troops in 1870.</p>
    <div class="subchap">EARLY RED RIVER CULTURE.
    </div>
    <p>Strange as it may seem, the isolated Red River Colony was far from being an
    illiterate community. The presence of the officers of the Hudson's Bay Company, the
    coming of the clergy of the different churches, who established schools, and the
    leisure for reading books supplied by the Red River Library produced a people whose
    speech was generally correct, and whose diction was largely modeled on standard books
    of literature. Mrs. Marion Bryce has made a sympathetic study of this subject, and we
    quote a number of her passages:</p>
    <div class="subchap">SCIENTIFIC WORK.
    </div>
    <p>The duty laid upon the Hudson's Bay Company officers and clerks of keeping for the
    benefit of their employers a diary recording everything at their posts that might
    make one day differ from another, or indeed that often made every day alike,
    cultivated among the officers of the fur trade the powers of observation that were
    frequently turned to scientific account, and we find some of them acting as
    corresponding members of the Smithsonian Institution in<span class ="pagenum">268</span><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a> Washington. Valuable collections in natural
    history have been forwarded to the institution by such observers as the late Hon.
    Donald Gunn, the late Mr. Joseph Fortescue, and Mr. Roderick Ross Macfarlane.</p>
    <p>Mr. William Barnston, a son of the Mr. Barnston, already mentioned, and a chief
    factor at Norway House, about 1854, was very fond of the cultivation of flowers and
    the study of botany, and some very valuable specimens of natural history in the
    British museum are said to have been of his procuring.</p>
    <div class="subchap">LIBRARIES.
    </div>
    <p>Collections of books were a great means of providing knowledge and contributing to
    amusement in the isolated northern trading posts.</p>
    <p>The Red River library had its headquarters in St. Andrew's parish, and was for
    circulation in the Red River Settlement. It seems to have been chiefly maintained by
    donations of books by retired Hudson's Bay Company officers and other settlers. The
    Council of Assiniboia once gave a donation of &pound;50 sterling for the purchase of
    books to be added to the library. There was one characteristic of this library that
    it contained in its catalogue very few works of fiction.<span class ="pagenum">269</span><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a> </p>
    <div class="subchap">LITERARY CLUBS.
    </div>
    <p>In addition to libraries we find that at a later date in the history of the
    Settlement, literary clubs were formed. Bishop Anderson and his sister, who arrived
    in Red River in 1849, were instrumental in forming a reading club for mutual
    improvement, for which the leading magazines were ordered.</p>
    <div class="subchap">EDUCATION.
    </div>
    <p>But we must now speak of more decided organization for the promotion of culture in
    Red River. The Selkirk settlers had now (1821) gained a footing in the land and the
    banks of the Red River had become the paradise of retired officers of the fur-trading
    companies. Happy families were growing up in the homes of the Settlement and
    education was necessary. A settled community made it possible for the churches and
    church societies in the homeland to do Christian work, both among the Indians and the
    white people, and to these institutions the Settlement was indebted for the first
    educational efforts made.</p>
    <div class="subchap">COMMON SCHOOLS.
    </div>
    <p>The Rev. John West, the first Episcopal missionary who arrived, in 1820, and his
    successors, the Rev. David Jones and Archdeacon Cochrane, as far as they could,
    organized common<span class ="pagenum">270</span><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a> schools on the
    parochial system. A visitor to the Settlement in 1854, John Ryerson, says that there
    were then eight common schools in the country&mdash;five of them wholly, or in part,
    supported by the Church Missionary Society, two of them depending on the bishop's
    individual bounty, and one only, that attached to the Presbyterian congregation,
    depending on the fees of the pupils for support. The Governor and Council of
    Assiniboia had, a few years before made an appropriation of &pound;130 sterling in
    aid of public schools. The Hudson's Bay Company may be said to have given aid to
    these schools indirectly by making an annual grant to each missionary of an amount
    varying according to circumstances from &pound;150 to &pound;50 sterling. The
    Catholics had similar schools for the French population along the banks of the Red
    and Assiniboine rivers, and the writer already quoted says that there were seminaries
    at St. Boniface, one for boys and one for girls, under the Grey Nuns from
    Montreal.</p>
    <p>Bishop Anderson, the first bishop of Rupert's Land, was not specially an
    educationalist. He turned his attention more to the evangelical work of the church.
    Bishop Machray, who came to the country in 1865, has, on the contrary, whilst not
    neglecting the duties of a bishop of the church of Christ, always given great
    attention to education, and the country is greatly in<span class ="pagenum">271</span><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>debted to him for the foundations laid. It was his
    endeavor after entering on his bishopric to have a parish school wherever there was a
    missionary of the Church of England, and in the year 1869 there were 16 schools of
    this kind in the different parishes of Rupert's Land. This is bringing us very near
    the time of the transfer when our public school system was inaugurated.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Jones, the wife of Rev. David Jones, the missionary of Red River, joined her
    husband in 1829. She very soon saw the need there was for a boarding and day school
    for the sons and daughters of Hudson's Bay Company factors and other settlers in the
    Northwest. A school of this kind was opened and in addition to the mission work in
    which she assisted her husband, Mrs. Jones devoted herself to the training of the
    young people committed to her charge until her death, which occurred somewhat
    suddenly in 1836. Mr. and Mrs. Jones were assisted by a governess and tutor from
    England and the Church Missionary Society gave financial assistance.</p>
    <p>Mr. John Macallum, who was afterwards ordained at Red River, arrived from England
    in 1836, as assistant to Mr. Jones. He took charge of the school for young ladies and
    also the classical school for the sons of Hudson's Bay factors and traders. He was
    assisted by Mrs. Macallum and also had teachers brought out from<span class ="pagenum">272</span><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a> England. He had two daughters who were pupils in
    the school, one of whom still survives in British Columbia.</p>
    <p>One of the Red River ladies who attended that school when a very little girl says
    that the building occupied by it stood near the site of Dean O'Meara's present
    residence. The enclosure took in the pretty ravine formed by a creek in the
    neighborhood&mdash;the ravine that is now bridged by one of our public streets. It
    consisted of two large wings, one for the boys and one for the girls, joined together
    by a dining hall used by the boys. There were also two pretty gardens in which the
    boys and girls could disport themselves separately. The large trees that surrounded
    the building have long since disappeared. The young girl spoken of as a pupil seems
    to have had her youthful mind captivated by the beauty of the site, and indeed
    nowhere could the love of nature be better cultivated than along the bends of the Red
    River near St. John's, where groves of majestic trees succeed each other, where the
    wild flowers flourish in the sheltered nooks and the fire-flies glance among the
    greenery at the close of day and where for sound we have the whip-poor-will lashing
    the woods as if impatient of the silence.</p>
    <p>Among other schools was one commenced in the early thirties by Mr. John Pritchard,
    at one<span class ="pagenum">273</span><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a> time agent of Lord
    Selkirk, at a place called "The Elms," on the east side of Red River, opposite
    Kildonan Church. Mr. Pritchard was entrusted with the education of the sons of
    gentlemen sent all the way from British Columbia and from Washington and Oregon
    territories, besides a number belonging to prominent families of Red River and the
    Northwest. The Governor and Council of the Hudson's Bay Company granted to Mr.
    Pritchard a life annuity of &pound;20 on account of his services in the interests of
    religion and education.</p>
    <p>On coming to the diocese in 1865 Bishop Machray reorganized the boys' classical
    school, and it was opened as a high school in 1866. The bishop gave instruction in a
    number of branches himself, paying special attention to mathematics. Archdeacon
    McLean had charge of classics and the Rev. Samuel Pritchard conducted the English
    branches in what was now called St. John's College.</p>
    <p>In connection with the parish school of Kildonan the Rev. John Black, who was, as
    we all know, a scholarly man, gave instructions in classics to a number of young men,
    who were thus enabled to take their places in Toronto University and in Knox College,
    Toronto.</p>
    <p>In addition to these schools, Mr. Gunn, of St. Andrew's, afterwards Hon. Donald
    Gunn, had for a time a commercial school at his<span class ="pagenum">274</span><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">
  </a> home for the sons of Hudson's Bay Company factors and traders, so
    that they might be fitted for the company's business in which they were to succeed
    their fathers.</p>
    <div class="subchap">GIRLS' SCHOOLS.
    </div>
    <p>From the death of Mr. Macallum, 1849, there was a vacancy in the school for girls
    until 1851, when Mrs. Mills and her two daughters came from England to assume its
    charge. A new building was erected for this school a little further down the river to
    which was given the name of St. Cross. This was the same building enlarged with which
    we were familiar a few years ago as St. John's Boys' College, and which has lately
    been taken down. Mrs. Mills is said to have been very thorough in her instruction and
    management. The young ladies were trained in all the social etiquette of the day in
    addition to the more solid education imparted. Miss Mills assisted her mother with
    the music and modern languages. Miss Harriet Mills, being younger, was more of a
    companion to the girls, and accompanied them on walks, in winter on the frozen river,
    in summer towards the plain, and unless her maturer years belie the record of her
    girlhood we may imagine she was a very lively and agreeable companion. In addition to
    her regular school duties Mrs. Mills had a class for girls who were beyond school
<span class ="pagenum">275</span><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a> age. She also gave assistance
    in Sunday school work.</p>
    <p>The pianos used in these school had to be brought by sea, river and portage by way
    of Hudson Bay; one of them is still in possession of Miss Lewis, St. James. The
    teachers from England had to traverse the same somewhat discouraging route in coming
    into the Settlement. Miss Mills, who came alone a little later than her mother and
    sister, traveled from York Factory under the care of Mr. Thomas Sinclair. She always
    manifested the highest appreciation of his kindness to her during the way, making his
    men cut down and pile up branches around her to protect her from the cold when his
    party had to camp out for the night.<span class ="pagenum">276</span><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">

    <div class="subchap">EDEN INVADED.
    </div>
    <p>The conception of Red River Settlement being an Idyllic Paradise was not confined
    to the writer, whose picture we have described as "Apples of Gold." It was a
    self-contained spot, distant from St. Anthony Falls (now Minneapolis) some four or
    five hundred miles, and this was its nearest neighbor of importance. Our astronomers
    thus describe it as an orb in space, and the celebrated Milton and Cheadle Expedition
    of 1862 looked upon it as an "oasis." It was often represented as being enclosed
    behind the Chinese wall of Hudson's Bay Company exclusiveness, and thus as hopelessly
    retired. The writer remembers well, when entering Manitoba, in the year after it
    ceased to be Red River Settlement, as he called upon the pioneer of his faith, who,
    for twenty years, had held his post, the old man said, when youthful plans of
    progress were being advanced to him, oh, rest! rest! there are creatures that prefer
    lying quietly at the bottom of the pool rather than to be always plunging through the
<span class ="pagenum">277</span><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a> troublous waters. Certainly, to
    the old people, there was a feeling of freedom from care, as of its being a
    lotus-eater's land&mdash;an Utopia; an Eden, before sin entered, and before "man's
    disobedience brought death into the world and all our woe."</p>
    <p>We are not disposed to press Milton's metaphor any further in regard to the
    disturbers who came in upon Frank Larned's peaceful scene.</p>
    <p>The time for opening up Rupert's Land was approaching. The agitation of the people
    themselves, the constant petitions to Great Britain and Canada called for it. The set
    time had come; 1857 was a red letter year in this advance. In that year the British
    Parliament appointed a large and powerful committee to investigate all phases of
    Rupert's Land, its history; government; geological, climatic, physical, agricultural,
    social, and religious conditions. The blue book of that year is a marvel of
    intelligent work. In this same year the British Government sent out the
    Palliser-Hector Expedition to Rupert's Land to obtain expert evidence in regard to
    all these points being considered by the Parliamentary Committee. Also in this year
    the Canadian Government dispatched the Dawson-Hind Expedition to obtain detailed
    information as to the physical and soil conditions of the prairie region,
<span class ="pagenum">278</span><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a> and it is said that the report
    of this party of explorers is one of the most accurate, sane, and useful accounts
    ever given of this prairie country.</p>
    <p>With all this attention being paid to the country and with the press of Canada
    awakened to see the possibility of extending Canada in this direction, it is not to
    be wondered at, that adventurous spirits found out this Eden and sought in it for the
    tree of life, perchance often finding in it the tree of evil as well as that of
    good.</p>
    <p>Of course, to the modern philosopher the disturbances of these peaceful seats is
    simply the symptom of progress and the struggle that is bound to take place in all
    development.</p>
    <p>But to the Hudson's Bay Company pessimist, or to the grey-headed sage, the
    greatest disturbers of this Eden were two Englishmen, Messrs. Buckingham and
    Coldwell, who, in 1859, entered Red River Colony, and established that organ for good
    or evil, the newspaper. This first paper was called "The Nor'-Wester." It is amusing
    to read the comments upon its entrance made by Hudson's Bay Company writers, both
    English and French. The constitution and conduct of the Council of Assiniboia was
    certainly the weak point in the Hudson's Bay regime, and the Nor'-Wester kept this
    point so constantly before the people<span class ="pagenum">279</span><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">
  </a> that it was really a thorn in the side of the Company. The
    Nor'-Wester, itself, was surely not free from troubles. The Red River Community was
    very small, so that it could not very well supply a constituency. Comparatively few
    of the people could read, many felt no need of newspapers, and the Company certainly
    did not encourage its distribution. It would have been a subject of constant
    amusement had the Nor'-Wester been in operation in the days of Judge Thom and his
    policy of repression. Mr. Buckingham did not remain long in Red River Settlement. Mr.
    Coldwell became the dean of newspaperdom in the Canadian West. The great antagonist
    of the Hudson's Bay Company, Dr. John Schultz, a Western Canadian, came to the
    Settlement in the same year as The Nor'-Wester&mdash;a medical man, he became also a
    merchant, a land-owner, a politician, and in this last sphere held many offices. At
    times he succeeded in controlling The Nor'-Wester, at other times the Hudson's Bay
    Company were able to direct The Nor'-Wester policy; sometimes Mr. James Ross, son of
    Sheriff Alexander Ross, was in control, but it may be said that in general its policy
    was hostile to that of the Company. About this time of beginnings came along a number
    of Americans, or Canadians, who had been in the United States, and these congregated
    in the little village, which began to<span class ="pagenum">280</span><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">
  </a> form at what is now the junction of Main Street and Portage Avenue,
    in Winnipeg. Certain Canadians in St. Paul, such as Messrs. N.W. Kittson, and J.J.
    Hill, began at this time to take an interest in the trade of Red River Settlement,
    and to speak of communication between the Settlement and the outside world. The
    demand for transport led a company to bring in a steamer, the Anson Northrup,
    afterwards called "The Pioneer," to break the Red River solitude with her scream. The
    steamer International was built to run on the river in 1862, and thus the Hudson's
    Bay Company was unwittingly joining with The Nor'-Wester in opening up the country to
    the world, and sounding the death-knell of the Company's hopes of maintaining
    supremacy in Rupert's land.</p>

       <span class="caption">THE ANSON NORTHRUP<br />
       The machinery was brought from the Mississippi to the Red River. The name was
      changed to Pioneer in 1860. "International," larger boat of similar pattern was
      built by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1861. These steamers were run on the Red
      River.</span>
    </div>
    <p>Until this time of arrivals there had been no village of Winnipeg. The first
    building back from the McDermott, Ross and Logan buildings on the bank of Red River,
    was on the corner of Main and Portage Avenue. Here gathered those, who may be spoken
    of as free traders, being rivals of the Hudson's Bay Company Store at Fort Garry.
    Another village began a few years after at Point Douglas on Main Street, near the
    Canadian Pacific Railway Station of to-day, while at St. John's, on Main Street, was
    another nucleus. These were in existence when the old order passed away
<span class ="pagenum">282</span><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a> in 1870, but they are all absorbed into the City of
    Winnipeg of to-day. The Hudson's Bay Company, while long attached to its ancient
    customs, brought over from the seventeenth century, has fully and heartily adopted
    the new order of things. Glorying in the old, it has embraced the new, and has become
    thoroughly modern in all its enterprises. It has been a safe and solvent institution
    in its whole history. That it has been able to do this is no doubt, largely due to
    the enterprise and modern spirit of its great London Governor, who for years watched
    over its time of transition in Winnipeg&mdash;Donald A. Smith&mdash;Lord Strathcona
    of to-day.</p>
    <p>When the regime of the Hudson's Bay Company is recalled old timers delight to
    think of a figure of that time who was an embodiment of the life of the Red River
    Settlement from its beginning nearly to its end. This was William Robert Smith, a
    blue-coat boy from London, who came out in the Company's service in 1813, served for
    a number of years as a clerk, and settled down in Lower Fort Garry District in 1824.
    Farming, teaching, catechising for the church, acting precentor, a local
    encyclop&aelig;dia and collector of customs, he passed his versatile life, till in
    the year before the Sayer affair, 1848, he became clerk of Court, which place, with
    slight interruption, he held for twenty<span class ="pagenum">283</span><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">
  </a> years. One who knew him says: "From his long residence in the
    Settlement, he has seen Governors, Judges, Bishops, and Clergymen, not to mention
    such birds of passage as the Company's local officers, come and go, himself remaining
    to record their doings to their successors."<span class ="pagenum">284</span><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">

    <div class="subchap">RIEL'S RISING.
    </div>
    <p>The agitation for freedom which we have described in Red River Settlement, and the
    efforts of Canada to introduce Rupert's Land into the newly-formed Dominion of Canada
    had, after much effort, and the overcoming of many hindrances, resulted in the
    British Government agreeing to transfer this Western territory to Canada, and in the
    Hudson's Bay Company accepting a subsidy in full payment of their claim to the
    country. This payment was to be paid by Canada. Somewhat careless of the feelings of
    the Hudson's Bay Company officers, and also of the views of the old settlers of the
    Colony&mdash;especially of the French-speaking section&mdash;the Dominion Government
    sent a reckless body of men to survey the lands near the French settlements and to
    rouse animosity in the minds of the Metis.</p>
    <p>Now came the Riel Rising.</p>
    <div class="poem"><p>Five causes may be stated as leading up to it.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The weakness of the Government of Assiniboia and the sickness and helplessness
    of Governor McTavish, whose duty it was to act.<span class ="pagenum">285</span><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">
  </a> </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The rebellious character of the Metis, now irritated anew by the actions of the
    surveyors.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The inexplicable blundering and neglect of the Dominion Government at
    Ottawa.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. A dangerous element in the United States, and especially on the borders of
    Minnesota inciting and supporting a disloyal band of Americans in Pembina and
    Winnipeg.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. A cunning plot to keep Governor McTavish from acting as he should have done,
    and to incite the Metis under Riel to open revolt.</p></div>
    <p>The drama opened with the appointment of Hon. William McDougall as
    Lieutenant-Governor of the Northwest Territories in September, 1869, and his arrival
    at Pembina in October. Mr. McDougall was to be appointed Governor by the Dominion
    Government as soon as the transfer to Canada of Rupert's Land could be made.
    McDougall, on his arrival at the boundary of Minnesota, was served with a notice by
    the French half-breeds, not to enter the Territories.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Louis Riel, son of the old miller of the Seine, and a true son of his
    father&mdash;but vain and assertive, having the ambition to be a C&aelig;sar or
    Napoleon, took the lead. He succeeded in October in getting a few of the Metis
<span class ="pagenum">286</span><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a> to seize the highway at St.
    Norbert, some nine miles south of Fort Garry, and in the true style of a Paris
    revolt, erected a barricade or barrier to stop all passers-by. It was here that
    Governor McTavish failed. He was immediately informed of this illegal act, but did
    nothing. Hearing of the obstacle on the highway, two of McDougall's officers came on
    towards Fort Garry, and finding the obstruction, one of them gave command, "Remove
    that blawsted fence," but the half-breeds refused to obey. The half-breeds seized the
    mails and all freight coming along the road coming into the country.</p>
    <div class="subchap">THE SCENE SHIFTS TO FORT GARRY.
    </div>
    <p>It is rumored that Riel was thinking of seizing Fort Garry; an affidavit of the
    Chief of Police under the Dominion shows that he urged the master of Fort Garry to
    meet the danger, and asked leave to call out special police to protect the Fort, but
    no Governor spoke; no one even closed the gate of the Fort as a precaution; its gates
    stood wide open to its enemies who seemed to be the friends of its officers.</p>
    <p>On November 2nd Riel and a hundred of his Metis followers took possession of Fort
    Garry, and without opposition.</p>
    <p>Riel now issued a proclamation with the air of Dictator or Deliverer, calling on
    the English parishes to elect twelve representatives to meet<span class ="pagenum">287</span><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a> the President and representatives of the
    French-speaking population. He likewise summoned them to assemble in twelve days.</p>
    <p>McDougall, prospective Governor, on hearing of these things, wrote to Governor
    McTavish, calling on him to make proclamation that the rebels should disperse, and a
    number of the loyal inhabitants made the same request. The sick and helpless Governor
    fourteen days after the seizure of the Fort, and twenty-three days after the date of
    the affidavit of the rising, issued a tardy proclamation, condemning the rebels and
    calling upon them to disperse.</p>
    <p>The convention summoned by Riel, met on November 16th, the English parishes having
    been induced to choose delegates. The convention at this meeting could reach no
    result and agreed to adjourn to December 1st. The English members saw plainly that
    Riel wished the formation of a provisional government, of which he should be
    head.</p>
    <p>At the adjourned meeting, Riel and his fellows insisted on ruling the meeting and
    passed a bill of rights of fifteen clauses. The English representatives refused to
    accept the bill of rights, and after vainly trying to make arrangements for the
    entrance to the country of Governor McDougall, returned home, ashamed and
    discouraged.</p>
    <p>Turn now to the condition of things in Pem<span class ="pagenum">288</span><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a>bina, from which prospective Governor McDougall is all this while
    viewing the promised land. He and his family are badly housed in Pembina, and he is
    of a haughty and imperious disposition.</p>
    <p>December 1st was the day on which the transfer being made of the country to
    Canada, his proclamation as Governor would come into force. But it so happened on
    account of the breaking out of Riel's revolt, the transfer had not been made.</p>
    <p>Now came about a thing utterly inexplicable, that Mr. McDougall, a lawyer, a privy
    councillor, and an experienced parliamentarian, should, on a mere supposition, issue
    his proclamation as Governor. Riel was aware of all the steps being taken by the
    Government, and so he and the Metis laughed at the proclamation. McDougall was an
    object of pity to his Loyalist friends, and he became a laughing stock for the whole
    world.</p>
    <p>His proclamation, authorizing Col. Dennis to raise a force in the settlement to
    oppose Riel, was of no value, and prevented Col. Dennis from obtaining a loyal force
    of any strength, which under ordinary circumstances he would have done.</p>
    <p>As all Canada looked at it, the whole thing was a miserable fiasco.</p>
    <p>The illegality of McDougall's proclamation<span class ="pagenum">289</span><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">
  </a> left the loyal Canadians in Winnipeg in a most awkward situation.
    One hundred of them had arms in their hands, and they were naturally looked upon by
    Riel as dangerous, and as his enemies.</p>
    <p>Riel now acted most deceitfully to them. He promised them their freedom, and that
    he would negotiate with McDougall and try to settle the whole matter.</p>
    <p>On the 7th of December the Canadians surrendered, but with some of them in the
    Fort and others in the prison outside the wall, where the Sayer episode had taken
    place, Riel coolly broke his truce, while the Metis celebrated their early victory by
    numerous potations of rum, from the Hudson's Bay Company Stores, and, of course at
    the Company's expense.</p>
    <p>Encouraged by his victory and the possession of his prisoners, Riel, now in
    Napoleonic fashion, issued a proclamation which it is said was written for him by a
    petty American lawyer at Pembina, who was hostile to Britain and Canada.</p>
    <p>An evidence of Riel's disloyalty and want of sense was shown by his superseding
    the Union Jack and hoisting in its place a new flag&mdash;not even the French
    tri-color, but one with a fleur-de-lis and shamrocks upon it, no doubt the flag of
    the old French regime with additions. He also took possession of Hud<span class ="pagenum">290</span><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>son's Bay Company funds with
    the coolness of a buccaneer, and his manner in refusing personal liberty to people
    whom he dared not arrest was overbearing and impertinent.</p>
    <p>The inaccessibility of Red River Settlement in winter added much to the anxiety.
    No telegraphic connection nearer than St. Paul, some four or five hundred miles, was
    possible, even the regular conveyance of the mails could not be relied on. Meanwhile
    the Canadian people were in a state of the greatest excitement, and the Government at
    Ottawa, well-knowing its mismanagement of the whole affair, was in desperate straits.
    To make the situation more serious the only man who could deal with Riel and could
    remedy the situation, Bishop Tache, of St. Boniface, was absent at the great conclave
    of that year in Rome. The more intelligent French people had no confidence in the
    sanity and reasonableness of Riel. He was to them as great a puzzle as he was to the
    English. It was a gloomy Christmas time in Red River, and the gloom was increased by
    the suspense of not knowing what the Government at Ottawa would do in the
    circumstances.<span class ="pagenum">291</span><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a></p>

    <h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
    <div class="subchap">LORD STRATHCONA'S HAND.
    </div>
    <p>On Christmas Day, 1870, John Bruce, who was but a figurehead, resigned his office
    of President of the so-called Provisional Government of Red River Settlement, and the
    ambitious Louis Riel was chosen in his stead. The Dominion Government had at length,
    been awakened to the danger. Divided counsels still prevailed. Two Commissioners,
    Grand Vicar Thibault and Col. De Salaberry, arrived at Fort Garry, but they were
    safely quartered at the Bishop's palace at St. Boniface, and as they professed to
    have no authority, Riel cavalierly set them aside. At this time the American element
    in the hamlet of Winnipeg became very offensive. Riel's official organ, "The New
    Nation," was edited by an American, Major Robinson. This journal was filled with
    articles having such head-lines as "Confederation," "The British-American Provinces,"
    "Proposed Annexation to the United States," etc., etc. Or, again, "Annexation,"
    "British Columbia Defying the Dominion," "Annexation our Mani<span class ="pagenum">292</span><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>fest Destiny." All this was very disagreeable to
    the English-speaking people, and highly compromising to Riel.</p>
    <p>But the real negociator was at hand, and he not only had the authority to speak
    for Canada, but had Scottish prudence and diplomacy, as well as real influence in the
    country, from holding the highest position in Canada of any of the officers of the
    Hudson's Bay Company. This chief factor was Donald A. Smith, whom we have since
    learned to know so well as Lord Strathcona. He, with his secretary, Hardisty, arrived
    on December 27th, and went immediately to Fort Garry. Riel demanded of Mr. Smith, the
    object of his visit, but received no satisfaction. On being asked for his
    credentials, Mr. Smith replied that he had left them at Pembina. Being a high
    Hudson's Bay Company officer, he was quartered in Government House, Fort Garry. The
    larger portion of the building was occupied by Governor McTavish, the smaller or
    official portion became the Commissioner's apartments. Here he was able to observe
    events, meet a number of the old settlers, and obtain his information at first hand.
    On the 15th of January Riel again demanded the Commissioner's papers; he, indeed,
    offered to send to Pembina for them, but Mr. Smith declined the offer. In the
    meantime the Commissioner had learned that the Dauphinais Settlement, ly<span class ="pagenum">293</span><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a>ing between Pembina and Fort Garry was loyal. Accordingly, with a
    guard, Hardisty started to bring the papers. Riel learned of this, and taking a body
    guard with him, went to the Dauphinais house, intending to seize the credentials.
    Hardisty arrived with his precious documents. Meanwhile, the Loyalists had made
    Riel's men prisoners, and when Riel attempted to interfere, Pierre Laveiller, a loyal
    French half-breed, put his loaded pistol to the Dictator's head, and threatened his
    life. Sixty or seventy of the Loyalists escorted Hardisty and his papers to Mr. Smith
    in Fort Garry.</p>

    <p>Now in possession of his documents, the Commissioner called a general meeting of
    the people for January 19th, and one thousand men appeared on that day in the Court
    Yard of the Fort. As there was no building in which they could assemble, the meeting
    was held in the open air, with the temperature 20&deg; below zero. The people stood
    for hours and listened to the proceedings. Commissioner Smith then read the letter of
    his appointment, and also a letter from the Governor-General, which announced to the
    people that the Imperial Government would see that "perfect good faith would be kept
    with the inhabitants of the Red River and the Northwest." The Commissioner then
    demanded that Vicar Thibault's commission, which Riel had seized should be read. Riel
    re<span class ="pagenum">294</span><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>fused it, but Mr. Smith stood
    firm. At length the Queen's message to the people was proclaimed. One John Burke then
    demanded that the prisoners be released and a promise was given. On the second day
    the people again assembled, and Mr. Smith then read authoritative letters, one from
    the Governor-General to Governor McTavish, and another to Mr. McDougall. It was then
    moved by Riel, seconded by Mr. Bannatyre, and carried unanimously, that twenty
    representatives should be elected by the English Parishes and twenty by the French,
    and that these should meet on January 25th to consider the subjects of Commissioner
    Smith's communications, and decide what was best for the welfare of the country.
    Speeches were made by the Bishop of Rupert's Land, and Father Richot and Riel closed
    the meeting by saying: "I came here with fear ... we are not enemies&mdash;but we
    came very near being so.... we all have rights. We claim no half rights, mind you,
    but all the rights we are entitled to."</p>
    <p>Begg, an eye-witness, says: "Immediately after the meeting the utmost good feeling
    prevailed. French and English shook hands, and for the first time in many months a
    spirit of unity between the two classes of settlers appeared. The elections took
    place in due time, but in Winnipeg Mr. Bannatyne, the best citizen of the place, was
    beaten by Mr. A.H. Scott,<span class ="pagenum">295</span><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a> and
    the greatest annoyance was felt at this by the better citizens on account of his
    being an American, and because of the 'New Nation' continuing to advocate
    annexation."</p>
    <p>On the 25th of January the forty delegates assembled. Much excitement had been
    caused at this time among the French by the escape of Dr. Schultz, their great
    opponent. Commissioner Smith addressed the Convention. Riel wished him to accept the
    original Bill of Rights, but Mr. Smith refused to do this. A proposal was then
    brought up by the French Deputies that the proposal made by the Imperial Government
    to the Hudson's Bay Company to take over their lands be null and void. This was voted
    down by 22 to 17. Riel rose in rage and said: "The devil take it; we must win. The
    vote may go as it likes, but the motion must be carried." Riel raged like a madman.
    That night, in his fury, he went to the bedside of Governor McTavish, sick as he was,
    and it is said, threatened to have him shot at once. Dr. Cowan, the master of the
    fort, was arrested, and so was Mr. Bannatyne, the chief merchant, as well as Charles
    Nolan, a loyal French delegate.</p>
    <p>On the 7th of February the delegates again met, and at this meeting Commissioner
    Smith, having the power given him by the Dominion Government, invited the Convention
    to send<span class ="pagenum">296</span><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a> delegates to Canada to
    meet the Government at Ottawa. Two English delegates, Messrs. Sutherland and Fraser,
    not quite sure on this point, visited Governor McTavish for his advise. "Form a
    Government, for God's sake," said the Governor, "and restore peace and order in the
    Settlement." Being asked, if in such case, he would delegate his authority to anyone,
    he hastily replied, "I am dying, I will not delegate my authority to anyone."</p>
    <p>The Convention then proceeded to elect a provisional government. Most of the
    officers were English, they being better educated and more prominent than the French
    members. But when it came to the election of a President, to their disgust Riel was
    chosen. Immediately after this, Governor McTavish, Dr. Cowan, and Mr. Bannatyne were
    released as prisoners, but Commissioner Smith was a virtual prisoner in his quarters
    in the fort, though his influence was still felt at every turn.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Among the earliest acts of the new provisional government was on February 11th,
    the confiscation of Dr. Schultz's property, and of the office of The Norwester
    newspaper. The type of The Norwester was said to have been melted into bar lead and
    bullets. Judge Black, Father Richot, and A.H. Scott were chosen as delegates to
    Ottawa, though the appointment of the last of these, the "American delegate,"
<span class ="pagenum">297</span><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a> was very distasteful to the English-speaking people. The success of
    Riel led him to dismiss about a quarter of the prisoners in Fort Garry. The fact that
    he seemed to hold the remainder as hostages stirred up the English people living
    along the Assiniboine.</p>
    <p>What is usually called the "Portage la Prairie" Expedition was now organized, to
    secure the release of the remaining prisoners. A body, varying from sixty to one
    hundred, marched down to Headingly, and were there joined by a number of
    English-speaking Canadians and others. They then pushed on to Kildonan Church, where
    they were increased by a number of English half-breeds from St. Andrew's and
    adjoining parishes. The proposal was to attack the fort and set free the prisoners.
    Alarmed at the movement, Riel released all the prisoners in the fort. Their object
    being gained, the men of the Kildonan Church camp, who had grown to be six hundred
    strong, dissolved, and were proceeding to their homes, when Riel, by an unheard of
    act of treachery, arrested some fifty of the Assiniboine party. Among them was Major
    Boulton, a former officer of the 100th Regiment. Riel again sought out a victim for
    revenge, and intended to execute this prominent man. It was only on the persistent
    request of Commissioner Smith and the urgency of Mrs. John Sutherland, whose
<span class ="pagenum">298</span><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a> son had been killed by an
    escaping French prisoner at the Kildonan Church camp, that Boulton's life was
    spared.</p>
    <p>Riel, however, seemed to feel that power was slipping from his hands. He was
    criticised on all hands for his treachery and for his arrogance. It is said his
    followers were dropping off from him, notwithstanding the luxurious lives they had
    been living on the Company's supplies in Fort Garry.</p>
    <p>He determined, though with a divided Council, to make an example, and despite the
    solicitations of Commissioner Smith, the Rev. George Young, and others, publicly
    executed, on the 4th of March, outside of Fort Garry, a young Irish-Canadian named
    Thomas Scott. It was a cold-blooded, cruelly-executed and revolting scene&mdash;it
    was the act of a mad man.</p>
    <p>"Whom the Gods destroy they first make mad." The execution of Scott was the
    death-knell of Riel's hopes as a ruler. Canada was roused to its centre. Determined
    to have no further communication with Riel, and feeling that he had done all that he
    could do, Commissioner Smith, on the 18th of March, returned to Canada. On the 8th of
    March, Bishop Tache returned from Rome. A few days after Chief Factor Smith's
    departure, he was followed to Canada by Father Richot and Mr. Scott, and they shortly
    after by Judge Black, accompan<span class ="pagenum">299</span><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a>ied by Major Button. The conflict of opinion was transferred to
    Ottawa, and the act constituting the Province of Manitoba was passed.

    <div class="subchap">WOLSELEY'S WELCOME.
    </div>
    <p>Canada's military experience, ever since the excitement of the "Trent Affair," had
    been in dealing with a persistent band of Irishmen, posing as Fenians, and egged on
    by sympathizers in the United States. Now there was trouble, as we have seen, in her
    own borders, and though here again, American influence of a hostile nature played its
    part, yet it was those connected with one of the two races in Canada who were now
    giving trouble in the Northwestern prairies. Such an outbreak was more dangerous than
    Fenianism, for to the credit of the Irish in Canada, it should be said that they gave
    no countenance to the Fenian intruders. The French people in Quebec, however, had
    strong sympathies for their race in the Red River Settlement. No one in Canada
    believed that any injustice could be done to either the English or French elements on
    the banks of Red River, but Sir George Cartier fought strongly for his own, and was
    very unwilling to allow an expedition to go out to Manitoba with hostile intent. Of
<span class ="pagenum">301</span><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a> the two battalions of
    volunteers that went out to Red River, one was from Quebec, but one military
    authority states that there were not fifty French-Canadians all told in the Quebec
    battalion. It had been proposed that Col. Wolseley, who was to command the Red River
    Expedition, should be appointed Governor of the new province of Manitoba, but this
    was sturdily opposed by the French-Canadian section of the Cabinet, and Hon. Adams G.
    Archibald, a Nova Scotian, was appointed to the post of Governor.
    Hampered thus, in so far as exercising any civil functions were concerned, Col.
    Garnet Wolseley was chosen by the British officer in command in Canada&mdash;General
    Lindsay&mdash;to organize this expedition. Wolseley was very popular, having served
    in Burmah, India, the Crimea and China.<span class ="pagenum">302</span><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">
  </a> The Ontario battalion soon had to refuse applications, and from
    Ontario the complement of the Quebec battalion was filled up. It was decided also
    that a battalion of regulars, with small bodies of artillery and engineers should
    take the lead in the expedition. Thus, a force of 1,200 men was speedily gathered
    together and put at the disposal of Colonel Wolseley. Two hundred boats, each some 25
    to 30 feet long, carrying four tons as well as fourteen men as a crew, were built;
    the voyageurs numbered some four hundred men. No sooner did the Fenians in the United
    States hear of this expedition than they threatened Lower Canada, and spoke of
    interrupting the troops as they passed Sault Ste. Marie. The United States also
    refused to allow soldiers or munitions of war to pass up their Sault Canal. The
    rallying began in May, and though the troops were compelled to debark themselves and
    their stores at Sault Ste. Marie, portage them around the Sault and replace them in
    the steamers again, yet all the troops were landed at Port Arthur on Lake Superior by
    the 21st of June, their officers declaring "our mission is one of peace, and the sole
    object of it is to secure Her Majesty's Sovereign authority." Some time was lost in
    endeavoring to use land carriage up from Port Arthur as far as Lake Shebandowan. The
    difficulties were so great that the scouts were led<span class ="pagenum">303</span><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a> to find another route for the boats up the
    Kaministiquia River. In this they were successful; in all this worry from mosquitoes,
    black flies and deer flies in millions, the troops preserved their good temper, and
    Col. Wolseley said, "I have never been with any body of men in the field so well fed
    as this has been." (July 10th.) The real start of the expedition was from Lake
    Shebandowan. The three brigades of boats&mdash;A. B. and C.&mdash;seventeen in all,
    got off from Shebandowan shore on the evening of July 16th; by the 4th of August
    Rainy River was reached, and at Fort Frances Colonel Wolseley met Captain Butler, who
    had acted as intelligence officer, having adroitly passed under Riel's shadow, and
    being able now to give the news required. It was still the statement and belief of
    Riel that "Wolseley would never reach Fort Garry." Crossing Lake of the Woods the
    regular troops were pushed ahead, and on descending Winnipeg River they reached Fort
    Alexander and Lake Winnipeg on August 20th. Here Commissioner Donald A. Smith, having
    come through in a light canoe, met Colonel Wolseley. After a short delay Colonel
    Wolseley's command hastened to the Red River, ascended it, and cautiously approached
    Fort Garry. It was still uncertain whether Riel was to oppose the expedition or not.
    The troops formed for what emergency might arise, and two small guns were
<span class ="pagenum">304</span><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a> in readiness should they be required. When Fort
    Garry was sighted, its guns were mounted, and everything seemed ready for defence.
    The officers of the expedition, as they approached it were quite ready for a shot to
    be fired from the battlements, but there was no movement, Riel, Lepine, and
    O'Donoghue alone, were left of the Metis levy, and as the 60th Rifles drew near the
    Fort the three were seen to escape from the river gate and to flee across the bridge
    of boats on the Assiniboine River. Capt. Huyshe states that the troops took
    possession of the fort with a bloodless victory, the Union Jack was hoisted, three
    cheers were given for the Queen and the Riel regime was at an end. The militia
    regiments arrived on the 27th of August, and two days afterwards the Imperial troops
    started back to their headquarters in Ontario. Captain Buller, who afterward became
    so celebrated in South Africa, took his company down the Dawson road to the northwest
    angle of the Lake of the Woods, and thus returned eastward, while Colonel McNeil left
    the country by way of Red River, through the United States. Shortly afterward, on
    September 2nd, Lieutenant-Governor Archibald arrived by the Winnipeg River route, and
    began his work.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Close in the wake of Wolseley's Expedition, there arrived on the 2nd of September,
    Adams G. Archibald, the newly-appointed Governor of the new Province of Manitoba. His
    arrival was greeted with joy, for he was a man of high character, and of much
    experience in his native Province of Nova Scotia. The two volunteer regiments, the
    Quebec and Ontario battalions, were quartered for the winter, the former in Lower
    Fort Garry, the latter in Fort Garry. The new Governor took up his abode in Fort
    Garry, in the residence with which our story is so familiar. The organization of his
    government began at once. The first Government Building stood back from the street in
    Winnipeg on the corner of Main Street and McDermott Avenue East, of the present-day.
    The Legislative Council&mdash;a miniature House of Lords&mdash;of seven members, was
    appointed, and electoral divisions for the election of members to the Legislative
    Assembly were made to the number of twenty-four&mdash;twelve French and
<span class ="pagenum">308</span><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a> twelve English. The time for
    the opening of Parliament was the spring of 1871. It was a notable day, for the
    citizens were much interested in scrutinizing those who were to be their future
    rulers. The opening passed off with eclat. During the first session certain
    elementary legislation was passed including a short school act. There was yet no
    division of parties, and a sufficient cabinet was chosen by the Governor. Thus,
    institutions after the model of the mother of Parliaments at Westminster were evolved
    and Manitoba&mdash;the successor of our Red River Settlement&mdash;had conceded to it
    the right of local self-government.</p>
    <p>In the year of the first parliament of Manitoba it was the fortune of the writer
    to take up his abode here. Winnipeg, a village of less than three hundred inhabitants
    was in that year, still four hundred miles distant from a railway. From the railway
    terminus in Minnesota, the stage coach drawn by four horses with relays every twenty
    miles, sped rapidly over prairies, smooth as a lawn to the site of the future city of
    the plains.</p>
    <p>Since that time well-nigh forty years has passed away. The stage coach, the Red
    River cart, and the shaganappi pony are things of the past, and several railways with
    richly furnished trains connect St. Paul and Minneapolis with the City of Winnipeg.
    More import<span class ="pagenum">309</span><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a>ant, the skill of
    the engineer has surpassed what we then even dreamt of in his blasting of rock
    cuttings and tunnels through the Arch&aelig;an rocks to Fort William, and this has
    been done by three main trunk lines of railway. The old amphibious route of the fur
    traders and of Wolseley's Expedition has been superseded, the tremendous cliffs of
    the north shore of Lake Superior have been levelled and the chasm bridged. To the
    west the whole wide prairie land has been gridironed by railways all tributary to
    Winnipeg, the enormous ascent of the four Rocky Mountain ranges, rising a mile above
    the sea, have been crossed by the Canadian Pacific Railway. The giddy heights of the
    Fraser River Canyon are traversed, and this is but the beginning, for three other
    great corporations are bending their strength to pierce the passes of the Rocky
    Mountains to the Pacific Ocean. We see to-day scenes more after the manner of the
    Arabian Nights Entertainments than of the humble dream that Lord Selkirk dreamt one
    hundred years ago.</p>

    <p>The towns and cities of Manitoba have sprung up on every hand where the railway
    has gone and these are but the centres of business of twenty thousand farms whose
    owners have come to this land, many of them empty-handed, and are now blessed with
    competence and in many cases wealth. What a vindication of<span class ="pagenum">311</span><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>
    Lord Selkirk's prospectus of a hundred years ago when he said: "The
    soil on the Red River and the Assiniboine is generally a good soil, susceptible of
    culture and capable of bearing rich crops." Lord Selkirk's dream is fulfilled, for
    his land is fast becoming the grainary of the world. As the traveller of to-day
    passes along the railways in the last days of August or early in September, he
    beholds the sight of a life-time, in the rattling reapers, each drawn by four great
    horses, turning off the golden sheaves of wheat and other cereals. A little later the
    giant threshers, driven by steam power, pour forth the precious grain, which is
    hurried off to the high elevators for storage, till the railways can carry it to the
    markets of the world to feed earth's hungry millions. When the historian recalls the
    statement that the few cattle of the early settlers had degenerated in size on
    account of the climatic conditions, that the shaganappi pony could never do the work
    of the stalwart Clydesdale, and that nothing could result from the straggling flock
    of foot-sore and dying sheep, driven by Burke and Campbell from far-distant Missouri,
    we look with astonishment at the horses now taken away by hundreds to supply with
    chargers the crack cavalry regiments of the Empire, at the vast consignments of
    cattle passing through Winnipeg every day to feed the hungry, and flocks of sheep
    supplying wool for Eastern manufacturers to clothe the naked.<span class ="pagenum">312</span><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a> </p>
    <p>One of the greatest trials of the early Selkirk Settlers was to get schools
    sufficient to give the children scattered along the river belt, even the three R's of
    education. Kildonan parish manfully raised by subscription the means, unaided by
    Government help, to give some opportunity to their children. It is a notable fact
    which emerged in the great School Contention of twenty years ago in Manitoba, that
    not a dollar had been given to schools as aid by the old Government of Assiniboia.
    To-day the glory of Manitoba is its school system. For school buildings, school
    organization, attainments of the teachers, and efficient school management, the
    schools of Winnipeg are probably unsurpassed in any country, and the same is true of
    many other places in the Province. Two Winnipeg schools bear the names of Selkirk and
    Isbister. The University of Manitoba, with its seven affiliated colleges and twelve
    hundred and forty candidates in 1909 for its several examinations has its seat at the
    forks of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers, and one of the colleges is on the very lot
    where Lord Selkirk stood and divided up their lands to the Colonists.</p>

    </div>
    <p>One of the most continued and aggressive struggles which Lord Selkirk's Colonists
    maintained was seen in the efforts put forth to worship God according to the dictates
    of their own consciences, and after the manner of their<span class ="pagenum">313</span><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a> fathers. Their perseverance which showed itself in
    the erection of old Kildonan Church in the year immediately after the destructive
    flood of 1852, bore fruit in succeeding years. They were always a religious people.
    No one can even estimate what their religious disposition did in a
<span class ="pagenum">314</span><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a> miscellaneous gathering of
    people who had, being scattered over the posts of the fur traders, been in most
    cases, without any religious opportunities whatever, before their coming to settle on
    Red River. The sturdy stand for principle which the Selkirk Colonists made created an
    atmosphere which has remained until this day. The well-nigh forty years of religious
    life of Manitoba has been marked by a good understanding among the several churches,
    by an energetic zeal in carrying church services in the very first year of their
    settlement to hundreds of new communities. The generosity of the people in erecting
    churches for themselves in maintaining among themselves their cherished beliefs, is
    in striking contrast to the new settlements of the United States. In the new Western
    States the religious movements fell behind the Western march of the immigrant. In the
    Canadian West from the very day that old Verandrye took his priest with him, from the
    time when the first Colonists brought a devout layman as their religious teacher with
    them, from the hour when the stalwart Provencher came, from the era when the
    self-denying West visited the Indian camps and Settlers' camp alike, from the time
    when the saintly Black came as the natural leader of the Selkirk Colonists, and
    during the forty years of the development of Manitoba, the foundations have been laid
    in that righteousness which exalteth a nation.<span class ="pagenum">315</span><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">

    <p>How strange and wonderful is the web of destiny, which is being woven in our
    national, provincial and family life, which we poor mortals are simply the individual
    strands.</p>
    <p>How marvellous it is to look into the seeds of time&mdash;yes, and these may be
    small as mustard seeds&mdash;which are the smallest of all seeds&mdash;and see the
    bursting of the husks, the peering out of the plumule, the feeding of the sprout, the
    struggle through the clods, the fight with frost and hail and broiling sun, and
    canker worm and blight, the growth of the strengthening stem, and then the leaf and
    blossoms and fruit! We say it has survived, it becomes a great tree under whose
    leaves and under whose branches the fowls of Heaven find shelter. How passing strange
    it was to see the seed-thought rise in<span class ="pagenum">316</span><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a> the mind of Lord Selkirk, that suffering humanity transplanted to
    another environment might grow out of poverty, into happiness and content. See his
    sorrow as he meets with undeserved opposition from rival traders, from slanderous
    agents, from bitter articles in the press, from Government officials and even police
    officers who strive to break up his immigrant parties. Recall the troubles of the
    Nelson Encampment as they reach him in letters and reports. Think of the misery of
    knowing thousands of miles away that his Colonists were starving, were being
    imprisoned, banished, seduced from their allegiance, and in one notable case that men
    of honor, education and standing to the number of twenty, were massacred, while he,
    in St. Mary's Isle, in Montreal, or in Fort William, fretted his soul because he
    could not reach them with deliverance.</p>

    <p>The world looked coldly on and said, "A visionary Scottish nobleman! a dreamer a
    hundred years before his time! Is it worth while?" while he himself saw a dream of
    sunshine when he visited his Colonists on Red River, when he made allocations for
    their separate homes for them, when he pledged his honor and estate that the settlers
    might in time be independent, and when he made religious provision for both his
    Protestant and Catholic settlers, yet think of the unexampled ferocity with which he
    was<span class ="pagenum">317</span><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a> attacked upon his return to Upper Canada, in law suits, and illegal
    processes, so that his estates became heavily encumbered, so that he went to France
    to pine away and die. The world failed to see any glamour in him, and carelessly
    said, what does it profit? Folly has its reward.</p>
    <p>Yet the answer. Here is Manitoba to-day, it is the fruitage of all that bitter
    sowing time. Next year Manitoba will be in the fortieth year of its history. Its
    people have seen pain, strife and defeat, they have gone through excitement and
    anxiety and patient waiting, and at times have almost given up the strife. But the
    province and its great city, Winnipeg, are the meeting place of the East and West,
    the pivotal point of the Dominion. The national life of Canada throbs here with a
    steadier beat and a more normal pulse than it does in any other part of Canada, its
    dominating Canadian spirit is so hearty and so sprightly, that, it is taking
    possession of the scores of different nations coming to us and they feel that we are
    their friends and brothers. This, while it may not be the noisy and blatant type of
    loyalty is a practical patriotism which is making a united, sane and abiding type of
    national character.</p>
    <p>Again we answer: Three years from now will be the hundredth year since the landing
    on the banks of Red River of the first band of<span class ="pagenum">318</span><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">
  </a> Selkirk Colonists. It was as we have seen a struggle of an
    extraordinarily bitter type. To us it seems that no other American Colony ever had
    such a continuous distressing and terrific struggle for existence as had these
    Scottish Settlers, but we say it was worth while, judging by the loss to Canada of
    the northern portions of the tier of states of Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana and
    Washington, which a line from Fond du Lac (Duluth) to the mouth of the Columbia would
    have given to us, and which should have been ours. We say that had it not been for
    the Selkirk Colonists we would have stood to lose our Canadian West. It was a
    settlement nearly a hundred years ago of families of men and women, and children that
    gave us the firm claim to what is now the three great provinces of Manitoba,
    Saskatchewan and Alberta. Was it not worth while? Was it not worth ten, yes, worth a
    hundred times more suffering and discouragement than even the first settlers of Red
    River endured to preserve our British connection which the Hudson's Bay Company,
    loyal as it was, with its Union Jack floating on every fort, could not have preserved
    to us any more than it did in Oregon and Washington. It was the Red River Settlement
    that held it for us.</p>
    <p>We are beginning to see to-day that Canada could not have become a great and
    powerful<span class ="pagenum">319</span><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a> sister nation in the
    Empire had the West not been saved to her. The line of possible settlement has been
    moving steadily northward in Canada since the days when the French King showed his
    contempt for it by calling it "a few arpents of snow." The St. Lawrence route was
    regarded as a doubtful line for steamships, Rupert's Land was called a Siberia, but
    all this is changing with our Transcontinental and Hudson's Bay railways in prospect.
    In territory, resources, and influence the opening up of the West is making Canada
    complete. And, if so, we owe it to Lord Selkirk and to Selkirk Settlers, who stood
    true to their flag and nationality. Very willingly will we observe the Selkirk
    Centennial in 1912. "Many a time and oft" it looked in their case to be one long,
    continued and alarming drama, but on the 30th day of August, the day of their landing
    on the banks of the Red River, shall we recite the epic of Lord Selkirk's Colonists,
    and it will be of the temper of Browning's couplet:</p>

    Labourers for the Company, (2) Settlers for the Red River Settlement. On this account
    in the lists given in the archives and other official documents, the labourers were
    often sent to the Posts of the Company, and after serving several years often became
    settlers. (List given in Manitoba Historical Society Transactions, 33.)</p>

    <p>In Martin's "H.B. Co. Land Tenures" is found a petition to the Prince Regent,
    after the troubles of 1816, asking for troops and steps to be taken for their
    preservation. As these are those, from all the different parties, who held fast to
    Red River Settlement, they are worthy of highest honour. These were the real Kildonan
    settlers whom Lord Selkirk saw on his visit in 1817.</p>

<p>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.org/license">http://gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
